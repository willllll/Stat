Description:Welcome UNC Chapel Hill Class of 2016!  This group was made as a resource for prospective and accepted students to network, ask questions, and to have fun!  

UNC allows you to request your own roommates, so as a current student I recommend you create a profile on www.roomsurf.com.  Roomsurf helps you filter through the thousands of other students looking for roommates based on a lifestyle questionnaire.  

If you have any questions/comments/concerns, feel free to msg/email/tweet me: ohhyojin@live.unc.edu   @JYulianaOh
