Description:Visit the VisionWalk page at http://www.fightblindness.org/goto/WashingtonHotRods 

I am walking in the Washington VisionWalk on October 5 to raise money for the Foundation Fighting Blindness and hope you will support me by joining my team, HOT RODS & SUGAR CONES.

When I was 10 years old, I was diagnosed with a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa. I hope that one day there will be a treatment that will delay my loss of sight or even restore it. However, research and clinical trials are not possible without continued funding and support. Be part of history and help make it possible for the blind to regain their sight.

 If you are unable to walk with us, please consider making a donation to this cause. Every donation ? no matter how large or how small ? adds up quickly. Also, you can show your support and spread the word about degenerative eye disease by joining the HOT ROD & SUGAR CONE facebook group.
