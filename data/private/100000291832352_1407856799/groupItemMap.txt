Description:Easing Abroad Students? Entry is a student organization founded to ensure that  international students have an incredible, fun and informative study abroad experience at UNC Chapel Hill.   As members of this organization, we help EASE the transition of these students. Each incoming international student is paired with a four year UNC student. The "mentor" contacts his or her international student during the weeks leading up to the student's arrival, ensuring that the student is both informed and excited the trip. Mentors facilitate the student's arrival from the airport, then follow up over the semester to make sure the international student is enjoying the experience and is being exposed to UNC's wealth of social groups and student organizations.  EASE also sponsors several social events each month where international and domestic students can all meet as fun, global community.

Name:Computer Science
Description:People should post interesting events/occurrences of Computer Science related things, relevant news articles, stories, discussions about classes and schedules, and anything else you'd like directed towards CS people.

Update on posting policies (from Matthew Leming, 1-5-2014): We will now be deleting the following kinds of posts advertising for group projects:

1. Projects in which interested persons are required to message the poster for further details.
2. Unpaid projects proposed by *individuals* without any computer programming experience (if, say, a local charity wanted to advertise for a dev here, that has a little more clout to it than one student with an idea for an app). If, however, you're a programmer and just need more people on your project, that's A-OK.
