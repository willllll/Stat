Name:The Carolina Experience LLC 2011-2012
Description:The Carolina Experience aims to be a first-year experience-based living-learning community with a focus on how students enter the college environment, make connections across the campus, and find a way to make a true impact in their own lives and beyond. With this, the concept of the Carolina Way will be inserted intentionally into the programs and experiences each student will encounter. Students in this community are responsible for being partners in the discovery process and develop a cohort mentality. 

The basic questions that each student will need to be able to answer by the end of the program are, "What does the Carolina Way mean to you?" and, "How will you leave your HEELprint?"
