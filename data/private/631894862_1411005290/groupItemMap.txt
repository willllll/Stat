Name:Computer Science
Description:People should post interesting events/occurrences of Computer Science related things, relevant news articles, stories, discussions about classes and schedules, and anything else you'd like directed towards CS people.

Update on posting policies (from Matthew Leming, 1-5-2014): We will now be deleting the following kinds of posts advertising for group projects:

1. Projects in which interested persons are required to message the poster for further details.
2. Unpaid projects proposed by *individuals* without any computer programming experience (if, say, a local charity wanted to advertise for a dev here, that has a little more clout to it than one student with an idea for an app). If, however, you're a programmer and just need more people on your project, that's A-OK.

Name:UNC-Chapel Hill Ride Share Group!
Description:Want to travel anywhere around North Carolina? Maybe Wilmington, or somewhere in Virginia without spending a fortune on gas or flights, and with some good company?

Put up a post if you're driving somewhere another student might want or need to go or if you need a ride and are willing to pitch in for gas! Put the dates you want to leave and return, where specifically you're going/want to go, etc. This group is a great way to find ways to travel cheaper, faster, and to get to know some cool people along the way!

Invite everyone you know who goes to UNC because the more people that join this group the more likely everyone will be able to find rides and passengers! Bon voyage!

Ride Share is a carpool program in many major cities and colleges. If you need a ride post about it on the wall, and the idea is that another UNC student with planes on going to that same location will carpool with you for little or no cost. (GAS MONEY!!!!)
