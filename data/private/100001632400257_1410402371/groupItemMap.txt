Name:Minor in Entrepreneurship at UNC-Chapel Hill
Description:Liberal arts and sciences students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill can explore the process of transforming their ideas- commercial, social, artistic and scientific- into reality in a new academic Minor in Entrepreneurship offered by the Department of Economics in the College of Arts and Sciences. 

The minor is designed for undergraduates who wish to complement their major area of study with an understanding of what is involved in creating a new venture of any kind. 

The minor is currently offered in four tracks:  business entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, scientific and artistic entrepreneurship.

The minor requires four courses, a prerequisite and a summer internship:

?	Prerequisite:  Principles of Economics, ECON 101 ? focuses on the economic system that is integral to both social and commercial entrepreneurship.

?	Introduction to Entrepreneurship, ECON 325 ? provides a historical overview of the role and importance of entrepreneurship in the economy and society, a framework for approaching entrepreneurship and innovation, and exposure to the core competencies required of all entrepreneurs. The course incorporates case-studies and speakers ? top entrepreneurs from across the country ? to provide context for entrepreneurial topics covered in the course.  

?	Commercial Venture Creation (ECON 327-01), Social Venture Creation (PLCY 326), Scientific Venture Creation(ECON 327-02) or Artistic Venture Creation (ECON 327-03) ? examine the concepts and tools needed to pursue various ventures. The courses take students through the process of creating a detailed plan for a proposed venture.

?	Capstone Course in Entrepreneurship, ECON 328 ? provides an opportunity for reflection on lessons learned from the entrepreneurship courses and internship experience. This course is designed to be taken after the required internship.

?	Elective ? one elective from a list of approved courses.  For a list of approved elective courses visit the CEI Web site, www.unc.edu/cei/minor.

?	Internship in Entrepreneurship ? provides a direct, supervised experience in the process of entrepreneurship, typically during the summer after students complete introductory and venture creation courses.

Admission to the minor is achieved by enrollment in ECON 325 by permission of the instructors.  Permission forms are available on the CEI Web site, www.unc.edu/cei/minor.
