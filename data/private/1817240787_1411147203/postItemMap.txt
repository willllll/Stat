The good thing is that all the things out there like it can be overcome with the right treatment, support, and friends. I just finished seeing The Aviator. Howard Hughes lived before what we know now. He was pretty amazing either way. Leonardo DiCaprio does great in this.

At least we can have fun with all the amazing things that are here though. It's just all pretty weird if you think about it.

Name:Vitality
Story:N/A
Message:For my first media production at UNC, I was assigned a "Poetry in Motion" project, a 1 minute production. I chose the word "Vitality": a lively or energetic quality; capacity to live and develop. I was given the artistic freedom to represent "vitality" through whatever means. For me, the best representation of vitality was through the the diversity of nature. The various forms of life that we see around us all look different but essentially require the same means of survival. As humans...we're so diverse...whether culturally or mentally. However, I believe...when we learn to look past those differences, that's where true love is found and we can all live and grow together. I encourage you all to find your own vitality.

Message:The cool kid that couldn't keep his painting got his painting back. It really is amazing what we can do digitally now. My good friend Cecilia got to see her son paint his first painting as part of a group that Kidzu Museum and The Frank Gallery hosted for his class. The group painting was one where the students all painted together on the same canvas in different colors. Each student chose a color that they thought displayed the emotions they had that day. This was inspired by professional artist Murray Handler whose painting these kids analyzed just before they began to paint together. You can see the paintings they were inspired by at the link with this of the Connectivity Series of paintings. The only bummer about the painting they did is that none of the kids got to keep the painting because it was just one painting made by a group of kids so the museum got to keep it. Cecilia was hoping she could get a print of the painting and all she had was a one megabyte jpeg photo from her iphone so I asked her if she could email it to me to see what I could do. I did some photoshop color improvements and some enlarging measures before giving the improvement to my friend Wojtek Wojdynski who did the final photoshop work and printing. He literally replicated the painting on to the exact same size canvas as the original so good that the people at Kidzu thought the colors looked better than the original. Woytek is one of the best printers and one of the nicest people there is. There are multiple photos here of Rami, his reunited painting, and the original painting in this facebook photo slideshow. This first photo is Rami once he got the replicated painting after thinking he wouldn't be able to keep his painting and the other photos in this slideshow after it are the photos from the finished color improvements to the original iphoto photo of the original painting on the wall at the Frank Gallery the day the painting was made. The paintings it was inspired by are at this link in the Connective Series. http://www.murryhandler.com/galleries/connectivity-series/

Message:Hey Cam! How have you been, man? I love reading your facebook posts, they're always really encouraging and enjoyable! So, I don't know if you knew it, but I'm spending the semester in Beijing, which has been an absolute blast. I love China a lot. Before I left though, I bought my Dad's old camera, which is Canon digital EOS Rebel 300 with a Sigma DG 28-300mm lens. It's really nice, and I've been really pleased with the results I'v been getting (also, using it is a lot of fun), but truth be told, I know nothing about  photography (besides what my dad told me about adjusting ISO and aperture value) and you're a really amazing photographer, so I was wondering if you have any tips for a young man with a solid camera who wants to improve his photography skills. Thanks Cam, and God bless!

Message:If you have kids be careful if they get strep throat or a similar infection. The bacteria can damage a part of their brain. It can do more to your kids than you know. It can be what creates anxiety disorders and ocd in people although most people don't know it actually could have come from Pandas -- Pediactric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections. So many kids get these from Pandas and no one ever knows that is where it came from and many people don't even know that they even had Pandas that created neurological dirsorder like ocd, social anxiety, and other anxiety disorders.

Message:"Student hackathon organizers deliver all the professionalism you'd expect from seasoned workers.  'They succession-plan.  They recruit.  They interview.  They onboard.  They do all the things you do in a startup to make a team lie beyond yourself, and they do it every single semester.  They also do it with a level of assistance that approaches near zero.  Most of these kids are seriously putting all this on their own personal credit cards."  

Such a sweet shoutout from this book!-- the book is currently free, but I'm not finished reading it so I don't know whether to recommend it or not.

It's happening all over and I'm scared that it's going to become infectious just because they're protecting one white cop from the consequences of shooting an unarmed black teenager.

The animal lover/biochemist in me has taken over my Etsy shop again, and I've decided to donate 20% of all proceeds from my "Wildlife Collection" to the WWF Endangered Species Conservation Project. These special planters are between 3 and 4 times the size of my previous planters (perfect for cacti, flora, and bonsai trees!) and are available in any colour and pattern. In addition to this, I'm going to be offering these planters with an exclusive glow-in-the-dark option, completely free of charge. 

Remember, the next 7 customers can still receive 10% off their entire order with the coupon code GRANDOPENING10

Story:N/A
Message:As someone who has struggled with rampant ADHD my entire life, reading this article has genuinely upset me. People who think that ADHD isn't biological or that children with ADHD are simply "over diagnosed" need to be informed before they become opinionated. Right now. I was not raised in a "structure-less household." I was not allowed sugary food items at my disclosure. I do not "lack self-control." To assert that I am any lesser of a human being, that I am not as civilized as a "normal" person, due to my ADHD is absolutely absurd and discriminatory. So Dr. Marilyn Wedge and all others who agree to her "findings" (if I can even call them that), kiss my well-accomplished, biochemistry majoring ass. I'll see y'all in the future when I rule the world.

Super close to campus at the corner of Columbia and Longview; only a 12 minute walk to Franklin and a 17 minute walk to campus. This is the best value you're going to find. It's also super convenient with the A and N bus lines picking up right in front of your door!

You'd be living with three awesome roommates and have a large FURNISHED room all to yourself.

Please message me for more details or pictures :)

It's been a while, and I definitely miss competing with you guys, but life gets in the way sometimes.  Anyways, my mom, some of you may remember her, is selling a few of her dresses, and a pair of practice shoes, ladies, if you're interested.  Here are the links to check out:

http://www.ebay.com/itm/321333677232?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649

I think she's willing to part with them for not much more than the opening price bid (75, 300, 30).  Message her if interested! (Dale Flowers) Thanks!

You got in to TFA and were placed in the Mississippi Delta to teach HS math. Your students thought you were the weirdest and most incredible human ever. You even started a ballroom dancing club. The student turnout was awesome. 

You were changing the world with math and dancing. 

Hope all is well, friend.

Message:Hey guys! I'm not usually for self-promotion but I thought I would ask you all to go like a page that Gelly Lieth and I have started. We're taking pictures of the people who make UNC the wonderful place that we've all come to know and love. We're also gathering their stories, comments, opinions, thoughts, and general wisdom to share with you all. I'm obviously a little biased but I think it's a great project. Those of you who have seen the Humans of New York page know how prolific people can be with their self-deemed 'inconsequential' one liners of brilliance. Our mission is to showcase the shining moments of humanity within our Carolina family. I hope you'll join our efforts by liking the page and spreading the love for our very special, very unique, and undeniably UNC humans.

Message:Hey french club officers!
Yaman Peksenar, Robert Alfredson, and I will be meeting after school on Monday, May 20th, to discuss plans for next year, and to reflect on this past year. Treasurer and Food Coordinator (for next year) are encouraged to come and contribute ideas, but you don't have to come if you can't.
The meeting shouldn't take too long, maybe 15-20 minutes, and we should be finished by 3 pm.
We are planning to meet in the Media Center if it is open, and if not, then in the Breezeway right outside of it.
Hope to see you there!

Message:In the U.S. you'll be hailed as a "nice guy" by an awful corner of the internet less than a week after you murder 6 people. There's only one requirement, be a white guy. Replace this with a black person and he's a thug. Arab? Terrorist. I would ask what a woman would be called but they don't go on shooting sprees.

Story:N/A
Message:The Song-of-the-day is "Glum," by Giant Sand.  "?painted-on smile on a real-life mask."  The enemy of the glum is hope, and having some familiarity with depleted hope, I offer this track to everyone who has shown patience, perseverance, caring (in other words, offered hope) to we who have experienced the glum. A partial list of providers of hope: Ed Messersmith,  John Barbour, Jim Garrison, Anna, Benkowski, Christine, Nyesha, Callie, and Anondo.

Message:I'm missing a kindred spirit today. Greg Hils was a remarkable friend and one of my greatest truth-tellers. He never failed to make sure I knew I was loved, something I think many take for granted when working with young people. His love, kindness, and support constantly challenged me to live up to what he seemed certain I could accomplish and, without a doubt, made me who I am. In celebrating his life this week, I rejoice in the knowledge of the lives he changed, the music he made, and the beauty he brought into this world, and I am honored that I was able to share in even part of that blessed journey. His friends and family are in my thoughts during this difficult time. 

Thank you, Hils. I'm so incredibly proud of you.

Message:Hey there!
I'm looking for a way to get to Greensboro on the 14th. If anyone is taking I-40 west for any stretch, I would be so grateful to tag along.  

Gas money and a huge, gas-station icee are in it for anybody who can help me out. I can also offer my services as road trip photographer or entertainer. I know a lot of fun games, and I do accents.

I'll also be looking for a ride back some time that weekend. So, if anyone heading back east after visiting with their sweetie is looking to make some money, hmu. I'll get you an icee too, and we can binge on day-after-valentine's-day candy. 

MESSAGE ME if this sounds convenient and acceptable to you!
thx

Story:N/A
Message:The ALS ice bucket challenge is definitely bringing awareness to the disease; there's no doubt about that. But just dumping a bucket of cold water on your head isn't enough. That shouldn't make you feel like you've done enough. Donations. Donations are what the challenge really is trying to inspire out of its viewers. ALS research doesn't get the funding it needs because it's isn't "profitable." But it takes away peoples bodies, bit by agonizing bit, and then it kills them. Donations and more funding for research are what will help find a cure. So sure, do the challenge, spread the word, that's a good start! But it's not enough.

Message:Hello, people of facebook! I have some really sad news. I can no longer keep the kitten I recently took in. My own cats are old and territorial and do not like him. Therefore,

Richard the Lionheart needs a new home.

It really breaks my heart that I cannot give him the home he deserves and needs, but I'm not about to take him to a shelter either. I desperately need your help.

He is about 8 weeks old, and very playful. He loves to run around and play with cat toys. He is a baby, so his energy levels are high and he needs someone who will have the time to play with him. When he is tired though, he loves to snuggle up next to you.

I've been taking him to the vet, and has begun his vaccines. He doesn't have FeLV or FIV. He is dewormed, and flea/tick free. I am willing to cover the cost of neutering. 

Please let me know if you or anyone you know is interested in giving Richard his forever home.

Message:I have been chosen by my boyfriend, Greg Stoughton, to do the positivity challenge this week. 3 positive things a day for 5 days. 
1) I am so thankful for my wonderful aunt, Deborah Barwick. She has helped me through thick and thin, loved me with all my flaws and merits, and imparted countless amounts of wisdom. I am so lucky to have such a wonderful aunt. 
2) I am so proud and thankful for my two siblings, Aimee Hyatt and Robert Decker. We have had our share of troubles, and although we are not perfect, we have become pretty amazing people. I'm so proud of the woman my sister is and the life she has created for herself. My brother and I have spent more time with each other than anyone else, and I see what a good man he is becoming. 
3) I am eternally blessed to have Greg Stoughton as my boyfriend. He is vastly intelligent, funny as hell, insanely handsome, and he challenges me and helps me grow as a person. The love he has for me and for life is enticing and beautiful. Bless his heart. 

I challenge Deborah Barwick and Aimee Hyatt this week. Think positive!

The Scrap Exchange is moving!  The Scrap Exchange is a crafts reuse store in Durham that people over at the Hackerspace there say has a pretty decent selection of electronic parts from time to time.  They are having a box sale, 10$ for a box of... stuff.  Seems legit, right?  Sale from 12-5 Sat, Sun, I will be going, leaving around 11.30 from the Sitterson lot on Saturday.  Everyone is invited to come with.  PLEASE COMMENT if you want to carpool with us.  We need to know how many cars to bring.

Message:About the Linux Users Group:

This is a call to arms for Linux users!  The department is getting pretty big, but we still don't have a LUG.  I've heard some voices of interest, so I'm going to go ahead and put together one, under the auspices of the CS Club.  At the General Meeting, I mentioned an interest meeting happening ...today - but on second thought, that was very short notice.  SO:

The interest meeting for the UNC LUG will be next Thursday, the 4th of September, at 6.30 in Sitterson 027 - the CS Club room.  We'll figure out what we want to do and where to meet.  If you are interested in helping administrate - message me on fb!

Message:Hey, you guys!  We are going to have our first meeting this Thursday at 7.30 (the traditional meeting time) in the hackerspace (SN 027).  We will go over meeting times, what we want to do, what I should bother Congress to get.  If you want to get involved (or reinvolved), now's a good time to start!  We'll probably get some food on Franklin after (that is, I'll be getting some food on Franklin after.)

*Things of interest* If you missed it, the hardware desks have been moved.  If you want to use them, they are in Project Development (SN 244).  This is accessible during school hours (7-5 I think but don't quote me on that) - they have the usual mix of basic electronic parts to mess with as well.  Jim Mahaney is in charge up there, smile and say you're with HatCH and you'll be okay.

Also, Jim has offered to let us rummage through the CS mothballed project warehouse to see if we can put some things to better use.  If you're interested in that, come to the meeting so I can get a better idea of what to tell him about that.

Message:*big introduction post* section C has to do with Matt's hackerspace post, pls read.

Hey all, I'm Roman!  I'm in charge of planning and coordinating HatCH and hackerspace things for the 14-15 year.  I'm a senior, computer science, and the first thing you should know about me is that I'm new to all this.  I'm here simply because I thought I could do a decent job of leading, which was interesting to me at a point nobody else seemed interested in it.  So if you want to work on something or do something, just speak up!  and don't be an ass.

when fall starts, we will have a planning meeting to iron things out, but for now, broadly, I want to work on connecting up with other hackery initiatives in the area to get a pulse on what's going on where, especially hackery things elsehwere in the university.  then we'll be able to know where cool things are happening, and what kind of cool things we want to do.  splatspace comes to mind.

so, then:  PARTICULARS

A.  stuff we have
This is a request for information on stiff in the hackerspace:

 * whose parallax ping ultrasonic sensor?
 * there's an incomplete sparkfun arduino starter kit - that's ours, right?
 * whose makey makey construction kit?
 * assorted parts of an irobot create?
 * and there's an arduino wired into a breadboard with a spliced open cat5 cable.  who was working on that?

B.  stuff we don't have

 * sooo, the quadcopter incident.  is this what we need, http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=21977 and is that all we need?
 * screwdrivers, i didn't find any.
 * can anyone think of anything else?  i need to know because i can probably get some more funding.

     
c.  where to put our stuff and do our stuff

you guys saw matt's post, if you didn't, read it.  here is my stance, with some clarifications.  First, transitioning the hackerspace into a more social space should  not impede our ability to do stuff there, or even meet there, if necessary.  It would actually be kind of ridiculous to have a social space for cs majors that didn't have some hacky stuff.  Second, I haven't seen anyone doing anything there that actually required the hardware benches, so if they are moved to somewhere they will be used more and replaced with regular desks, this should bother nobody.  Moving the hardware benches, specifically, will probably be the most important modification to the room, and is the one we are currently held up on.  Third, the hackerspace is the best location for a social CS space in the building.  The space upstairs is not tenable - the 'space upstairs'  we would migrate some of our functions into is a fully equipped and maintained hardware lab, and for this purpose cannot be opened to the general public.  This is a problem for the open nature of a 'hackerspace'.

For all this, i SUPPORT moving the desks to the space upstairs, renovating the room and getting interested club-and-school affiliated parties access to the hardware lab HOWEVER keeping enough desk space downstairs to continuing to meet there so we can keep our meetings as open as possible, per Forrest's legitimate concern, migrating upstairs if we need to do something particular, and keeping some of our stuff downstairs in one of the cabinets there that I think michael can get us a key to.

This said - The request for comment period on this transition will close at noon saturday because that's about how long it took for people to stop posting on Matt's post.

Tager man de kildekritiske briller p?, vil der blive rig mulighed for at diskutere begreber som orientalisme og autencitet :)

Message:Hey y'all! If you weren't able to hear our schpeel because you were in the very back of the room today, here it is condensed into one post for you!

alpha Kappa Delta Phi International Sorority, Inc. is currently hosting our Fall rush, which is an opportunity for everyone to come and learn about our sorority, what we do as an organization, and information on how to join our sisterhood. It's completely free and non-binding, so if you want to just come for the food and conversation, that's cool too.

All of the info can be found on our rush page: UNC aKDPhi's Fall 2014 Rush: Paint the Night Sky with aKDPhi. Or, if you aren't about clicking another link, you can take a look at our rush flyer for details about the events we're holding for the next two weeks!

Feel free to contact any of our sisters with any questions or for more info. :)

Message:Hey guys!

Have you ever wanted to know what it's like to stand up paddleboard or have you been before and love it?! Well, on September 21st we'll be leading a trip over to Hayden Island for three hours on the water on stand up paddleboards! No experience is necessary (although we will have to swim check before going) and it's only going to be about $30 for the whole thing (renting equipment included). Although, we may get a group deal if enough people sign up!

Basic Info:

Time/Date: 12:30pm - 4:00pm on Sept 21st
Price: $5 (or maybe less) for us and $25 for the rentals, though this may be reduced.
Experience: None necessary!

Sign up quickly cause while there'll be way more spots than normal on this one, they're bound to fill up quickly!

Story:N/A
Message:The definition of feminism states: "the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes."

By definition, we should all be feminists.  Yes there are people who are considered "extreme" feminists, but there are extremes in EVERYTHING. Why does feminism have such a negative connotation when all it is is the movement to make women and men truly equal for once? I suppose it's because of the patriarchal society that we live in, which is the same exact reason why the feminist movement exists and needs to exist in the first place.

If a girl proudly says she is a feminist, we should all be supporting her AND the movement.  Instead we tend to jump to conclusions about what feminism is - that she wants all guys to have no rights, wants men to suffer, etc.. NO. SHE ONLY WANTS EQUAL RIGHTS FOR EVERYONE.

The thing is, feminism won't get anywhere unless a part of the problem is a part of the solution. The problem is GUYS. This doesn't mean me or you or your friend is the one responsible for the patriarchal society and the unequal rights of women. It is not, I repeat, it is NOT, an individual attack when feminists talk about guys being the problem.  BECAUSE WE ARE THE PROBLEM. But we are the problem as a whole, not necessarily as an individual. All I'm asking is that all of my friends who identity as male take an active role in the feminist movement and be aware of your privilege and place in society as a male.

Feminism doesn't work if only one side is fighting for equal rights, we ALL have to fight. WE can change the world. Not guys, not girls, WE. Everyone. Together.

I am a feminist, and I am damn proud.

Message:My part of the project took place in a nice quiet area in King's College right beside their library. The environment reminded me of spending peaceful time alone and was a place where it seemed many people would go to get away from the hustle and bustle of every day life. Instead of asking about how the space made them feel I asked: "What is one benefit or disadvantage of spending time alone?" so that I could get to hear a piece of their story and how they view the world around them during a limited interaction. This was easily was one my favorite projects I've ever done while in college and was a testament to the fact that everyone has a different story to tell, a different view of the world, and, in my opinion, is a good person at heart. Here is the end product.

Message:Was able to take a break from my hectic schedule and visit the sunflower fields. These pictures don't do it justice... It was gorgeous! If you have a chance this week, head up to the intersection of Hess Rd and Route 146. They said that this week is the best time to go. It's definitely worth a trip up! The views are amazing and the walk is so peaceful. It was a great reminder that we should never be too busy to notice the beauty around us.

Message:I normally do not post Student Government related things on my personal facebook, but this is really important for all Carolina students to pay attention to.

For a long time, Carolina has made a remarkable promise to our students: if you are talented enough to earn a spot in Chapel Hill, we will make sure you can afford to come here. We cannot break that promise if we are to remain the University of the People. Jeopardizing our commitment to meeting 100% of demonstrated need would be a terrible consequence of this policy proposal and deeply counterproductive to the Board's core goal of affordability.

Club meeting this Wednesday at 5:00 PM. There will be PLENTY of pizza. So far, I have three people signed up to be there to present their summer internships, and I could use a LOT more (we had like eight or so last year). This is usually a very great thing, since students can get the "downlow" from other students on what's good about internships and what isn't. So, if you did something cool over the summer, email me, or sign up: http://bit.ly/W8BYFa

I'll be harassing more people about just this, so we'll likely have a couple more before Wednesday...

? NSA Table in Sitterson Lobby - Tuesday, Sept 16, 1:30 - 3:30 PM.

<jk>
So the NSA is coming to Sitterson! Their application process is a bit unique, FYI, so I'll outline it here. Here's how it goes:

1. Approach their table in Sitterson lobby.
2. Speak your first and last name audibly so that the microphones in their name tags will be able to pick it up, then walk away. Write it out on a napkin if the spelling is unique.
3. Wait a day or two.
4. Apply for literally any other tech company and get a phone interview with them. The NSA will already have your most up-to-date resume by this point.
5. If the NSA thinks you did well in this interview, you should hear back from them shortly!

? Sign up to get and give technical interviews (rramkuma@live.unc.edu).

Hello all

I am planning on holding a technical interview practice session during the weekend of OCT. 11. This event is for students who are interested in getting practice with technical interviews. These practice interviews will be 30 to 45 minutes in length. They will most likely be a one on one session where I connect students interested in interviewing with students willing to hold interviews.

If you are interested in taking part in an interview please fill out the following form:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zckGQGnnmZ2TJqAViX0s8gV0mpBI70lIsnYWkfKH8bk/viewform?usp=send_form

If you are interested in being an interviewer please email me at: rramkuma@live.unc.edu with your experience with technical interviews. I will send more details out later once I get a gauge of the interest. There may be an incentive to those who help with interviews!

? CS Volunteering for a local high school.
""
Hey guys--
Last year, I volunteered with the Carrboro High School Programming Club and helped the students there learn a little more about programming. However, having moved across the country, I can't help them out any more and would love it if one (or more!) of you guys could help take over for me.
Volunteering for these guys is very low-pressure. It would be best if you can chat about COMP110 level topics with them on a weekly basis; but it's likely that a number of them will already have programming experience so you won't have to do a lot of teaching. It would also be great if you were familiar with Python, but that's not absolutely necessary.
If you think you're interested at all, please comment here or send me a message. I am happy to talk more in depth about what the expectations are and put you in contact with the club's sponsoring teacher at the school.
Thanks!
Kai [Leith]

'"If you're familiar with the UNC Facebook groups, you know they are great helping students share information with those around them.  However, sometimes they are too good.  If I'm trying find a Psyc 101 textbook, I'm not going to want to sift through 300 posts.  The purpose of this application is to give users the power to see what they want to see. It is a platform which encourages users to contribute quality content to those around them, and also, enable a way for users to efficiently view that content. Users will be able to subscribe to certain categories giving them a personalized feed of nearby posts.  Additionally, users will be able to adjust the distance to which they wish to view posts.

I'm currently part of a team who is in the process of developing an android and IOS7 application for this purpose.  Since we plan to first launch with IOS, we're looking for anyone who has any experience with objective C.  So far, we have completed a wireframe, comprehensive work flow, and business strategy. I would be more than happy to discuss everything in detail over a coffee or over the phone.

We are planning on providing monetary compensation for each segment completed in the work flow. Since each segment is different, compensation could vary between $50-300 (per segment).  Currently, there are 14 segments in the workflow for the native IOS7 mvp, meaning we will ultimately be offering between $1400-2800 depending on the quality and timing of the work."

Message:Hey all!

First, happy-snappy FDOC! Just brief FYIs here, as well as an overview of the doings for the semester:

? The first CS Club meeting is Wednesday, August 27th at 5:00 PM in FB 007. We'll be going over the hackerspace, HackNC, WICs (separate-but-affiliated), tutoring, and various other stuff that's happening this semester. Still trying to get the room reserved, but this will kind of probably be the way it goes.
? COMP 110/116/(401) Tutoring will happen in FB 007 from 5:00 to 7:00 starting on August 28th. Message rramkuma@live.unc.edu if you're interested in participating as a tutor this semester so he can get you on the listserv. This is a hugely informal process. If you're interested, just show up.
? HackNC (http://hacknc.us) meetings will be happening Wednesdays at 8:00 in the CS Club room. Email Vance Miller (v@unc.edu) for more information.
? Join our Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/unccsclub/
? Undergraduate Open House is early this year ? Tuesday, August 26th, at 5:00 PM in SN 014.
? Microsoft events are on Thursday, August 28th, 2014, 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, and 6:30 PM (Resume Clinic) in the lower lobby. http://csclub.cs.unc.edu/Events/.
? More reliable GCal at http://www.cs.unc.edu/Events/Calendar/.

Additionally, Dr. Kevin Jeffay is the new head of the Computer Science Department! To celebrate, I would greatly appreciate it if everyone would go to http://yugico.com/yugioh-card-creator, photoshop Jeffay's head onto some image, create a Yu-Gi-Oh card out of it, and send the result to jeffay@cs.unc.edu with the subject line "Congratulations!". Head and example attached.

Thanks!

Brief update on sponsors:

? Kitware, Infusion, Microsoft, SAS, EMC, and (I think?) Google can all be reasonably classified as "in the works," in the sense that we've contacted members of those companies, they've replied, and I have warm fuzzies over their final decision to sponsor. I think Maegan has Google.
? A bunch of other companies are being contacted now, some of them by Michael Fern, some of them by me, a lot of others by people who are working at those companies now.
? It would be really nice if anyone knew people at Facebook, IBM, Deutsche Bank, and Palantir. I feel like these companies are around the department enough that *someone* at UNC will know someone working there.

Message:Hello,

There are talks happening about moving the hackerspace to the second floor computer labs and leaving the current space as a social area. None of the people involved in the talks really actively participate in HatCH. What do people here think about moving to the computer labs on the second floor? That would theoretically leave more desk space for hardware work and give access to new hardware . . . stuff.

A company called Lob reached out to us. I cannot comment on whether we'll sponsor their API since they won't sponsor HackNC, but Ashley from HackDuke was pleased with them as a t-shirt provider. They said $4 for t-shirts, which is around $0.50 cheaper than other providers I could find for two-sided, single-colored shirts. The contact was shrav@lob.com.

CS Club Presidents for 2014-2015: This last year, we had three CS Club co-presidents. This year, only three people are applying for the position. Most electoral systems carry out voting even when there is only one person on the ballot for a given position. While I have some qualms about not doing it, I also think that voting would be a bit of a farce given the circumstances. If one person disagrees and wants voting to happen regardless, I devised a system to do it fairly, but until then, we're just going to skip the voting part.

So, the CS Club Presidents for the 2014-2015 school year are Roman Myers, Rahul Ramkumar, and myself. Here are our platforms!

? Matthew Leming: "Computer science majors, I have learned, are like cats: very independent, and you can never really convince them to do anything they don't want to do, unless you have money (catnip). However, if they want to do something, you can't really stop them. The CS Club, really, is a group of students in the CS department that try to guess and act on the needs of these cats, as they arise. This year, we acted on this by ramping up hackathons (Clawges, Spanos, Miller, Lieth, Corallo, Busby, McGrath, Kronk, Hendel, Ramkumar ? thanks to all of you!); continuing the weekly tutoring program, which provides a nice way for younger CS students to learn from older CS students, and for older CS students to learn the art of teaching; and the hackerspace, which provides room for people to fiddle around with hardware projects every Thursday.

"In general with this coming year, the CS Club needs to focus on two things: welcoming and encouraging new students in the department, and fostering a community of hardcore coders that's normally only present in a technical school. For those of you who don't know, this major is skyrocketing: COMP 116 and 110 had to scuttle over to an auditorium in the Genome Sciences building just to accommodate the numbers, while Dr. Stotts and Kai Leith devised a system for future 110 classes to use fully automatic grading. This major is HUGE now, and it's the job of the CS Club to take these numbers and make full-blown nerds out of them.

"As a returning President of the CS Club, I will continue to write listserv messages, assist in organizing hackathons, run the tutoring program, and act as a liason between outside organizations and the computer science community (paperwork and emails). I will try to do my part in making the above happen by organizing workshops for introductory students at HackNC ? just so that that's less intimidating ? and working with the other co-presidents to make meetings happen about as consistently as they did this last fall (~once every two weeks, with food, etc.). Looking forward to a good year!"

? Roman Myers: "As a President of the CS Club, I would like to work on the 'Club' in CS Club.  While tutoring and coordinating opportunities are important functions - they are focused on priorities for us students as individuals.  I think the club could stand to benefit from more social functions - game nights, picnics, impromptu projects - things that encourage us to get to know one another in the department and help us remember CS is more than just schoolwork.  I also think the Hackerspace has a lot more to offer.  Inspired by the Sparkfun events at PearlHacks, I would like to lead HatCH into more short term one-or-two session DIY projects - aimed at people who haven't messed with much hardware.  By doing that, we would offer something that might bring in more people, even from outside the department.  From there, it would be easier to pitch HatCH as a student organization and secure student government funding to buy more cool things for all of us to mess around with."

? Rahul Ramkumar: "Hello, I am Rahul Ramkumar and I am a rising senior. I am in the running for the position of CS club president next year. I have been running the tutoring program for the past two years, so I have been active in the CS club. If elected CS club president I hope to make some changes to the program. First off, I hope to make the CS club an organization that helps its students to gain internships/full time positions. I hope this can be done through the following programs:
1. Interview workshops: I hope that these will be held once every semester. This program will allow students to practice for interviews,(both technical and behavioral). 
2. Resume Workshops: We all know a good resume is the key to getting an interview. Therefore, the CS club will hold resume workshops. Where upperclassmen/ company representatives work with students on how to improve their resume and gain those interviews
Furthermore, I feel the CS club should be more than just a career development group. I feel the CS club should also be a social group. Therefore we need to have social gatherings. Therefore, if elected CS club president I hope to have more social events (with food!). This way we can get together and build as a community. If you have any questions about my platform feel free to email me at rramkuma@cs.unc.edu."

IF YOU'RE AN INCOMING CS STUDENT AND YOU'RE REALLY INTIMIDATED BY THIS CURRICULUM, READ THIS!

(This is the edited version of an email that I wrote to an incoming transfer student, so I thought it would be a cool 30-second guide to UNC's CS Curriculum for incoming students eyeballing this over the summer.)

"First: join our Facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/unccsclub/), and sign up for this listserv (http://csclub.cs.unc.edu/). That'll be one thing that keeps you in touch with our community. There's also Women in Computer Science (https://www.facebook.com/groups/209467285885546/). That's strictly for women in computer science.

Resources: we have weekly tutoring program, in which older students tutor students in their first year of the CS curriculum. It's very chill. In the first year of CS, students often run into difficulties thinking about certain aspects of computer programming; there are a few concepts, like recursion and object-oriented programming, that are just difficult to get used to. But, no worries! Tutors help with that.

Usually, the computer science curriculum goes like this:

Semester 1: COMP 110/116 (110, preferably)
Semester 2: COMP 401 (you should probably also take 455 this semester)
Semester 3: COMP 410 and COMP 411 (AND 455, if you haven't already...you can also do 426 and 431, from what I've heard)
Semester 4 and on: free-for-all, really. COMP 550, preferably, but you can take whatever you want at this point. 500-level classes.

So it's designed to be completed in two years, though CS majors usually just explore whatever classes they want after their third semester.

Depending whether you want a BS or a BA, you also need to take MATH 231/232 (Calculus I and II), then MATH 381 (discrete ? or COMP 283, the CS version of discrete) and MATH 233 (Calculus III), and then MATH 547 (linear algebra) and STOR 435 (probability). Somewhere along the line, PHYS 116 (though the physics department is changing this around . . . I guess we'll see what they do with their classes sooner or later).

So, really, the only thing you immediately need to do is sign up for COMP 110 and whichever math course is necessary. You'll figure out pretty quickly what CS is about and how it's really not intimidating."

Okay, I'll make it clear why this new group is being made.

Basically, the previous group was made after this past HackNC by a senior leader of HackNC, who is now graduating. We're all extremely grateful for what the seniors did for HackNC, but Vance and I also felt that it is necessary to have everything run and administered by people who will be here next year. This is something we can definitely discuss, and I will be talking with the admins of the other group myself, but *this is the official HackNC group from now on*.

CS Club Meeting with JIMMY JOHN'S!!! Tuesday April 8th 5:30 PM FB 007. Vines for SEDS, the damn t-shirts, and HackNC meeting afterwards in the CS Club room.
 
First:
 
From Hannah Kerner's Facebook post:
 
"Hey everyone! This October UNC SEDS is hosting the largest student run space conference in the country, and we want Elon Musk, Founder and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla Motors (and a major supporter of SEDS) as a keynote and it is going to take a huge effort to bring him to campus. We are hosting a Vine Challenge for people to post their 6-second videos with the hashtag #ProjectElonNC telling @elonmusk why he should come speak at Memorial Hall on October 30th. The prize of the challenge is the opportunity to introduce him for his speech if he accepts. This means you could meet Elon Musk.
Please consider helping us out with this -- it only takes six seconds and the more Vines we have the more likely he is to find the time in his busy schedule to come across the country. Thanks!"
 
Yep, make a Vine this Tuesday, get a sammich. It's that simple.

Also, HackNC meeting after that. We'll divide into groups and stuff and get stuff underway.

I'll have your shirts there. I promise.
 
???
 
Yuri's Night ? Space PARTY! Saturday, April 12, 7:30pm (http://on.fb.me/1jSW3aK)

Yuri's Night events combine space-themed partying with education and outreach. For more information:http://yurisnight.net/
 
Yuri's Night in Chapel Hill will take place from 7:00-10:30 pm at Players Club at 159 1/2 East Franklin St.
 
This event is 18+ and will include jamming to stellar music, streaming out-of-this-world videos, and socializing with fellow space enthusiasts. The party is open to the public so invite all your friends!
 
???

Interview Skills Workshop ? Wednesday, April 9, 4pm-5pm FB007
 
Coding skills! Coding in interviews! Very useful! All are welcome to attend...
 
???
 
"Makers and Shakers" ? Wednesday, April 9 5:15pm?6:45pm (http://bit.ly/1iURyvA)
 
Successful startup teams require technical talent to build products (Makers) and business development talent to spread the word (Shakers). To help folks on campus build these cross-disciplinary teams and share startup ideas, we are organizing a regular gathering at UNC Chapel Hill.

I actually had to do this twice because somebody (ahem, Mustafa) accidentally missed the video button the first time, and not allowing me to finish my nominations the second time. Anyway, I have witness that I nominated Cuong Magick Tran, Sven Nevs, and Sebastian Geck the first time. And since Sven went right after me, Mohak Goel, I nominate you too. :D You have 24 hours to accept the challenge or donate to the ALS Foundation. Have funnnn!

You're one of the most genuine, honest, and empathetic people that I know. I hope your next year is full of memories and adventures! I'm so excited to see you next weekend! I hope your day was as fantabulous as you are, and that you "have a good night!" Love always! <3

Message:I have come to the realization that we haven't spoken since we both left in August. Like. Not at all. Now, lately, I've been letting birthday notifications float by, but I felt as though letting yours go would have been a definitive statement of... something not good, and I just couldn't have that. So, here we go. Megan Lott, I love you and adore you no less than I did the day we parted. As much as I enjoy it here in Boston and as much as I love the friends I've made here, there will always be a part of me that misses you, because you are absolutely unique and utterly irreplaceable. I should have told you that more often. I hope everyone that you've met and befriended at UNC realizes this, and knows how lucky they are to know you. You're so special and so incredible to me, and you deserve nothing but happiness and success because you never fail to earn it. I hope you are kicking butt and taking names like no one else in all of your classes (I know you are, because you're you).

I hope your birthday is at least half as brilliant as you are, because let me tell you, girl: you shine bright as the sun. Love you and miss you so much. 

(Hopefully I'll get to see you when our spring breaks intersect, which is next weekend?)

Name:CHAPEL HILL: UNC board proposes plan to limit tuition dollars for financial aid | Education |...
Story:N/A
Message:While I normally refrain from posting statuses on Facebook, let alone political ones, I think this is of the upmost importance.

Capping funding for financial aid at UNC would hurt every single UNC student, not only those receiving financial aid. UNC is a diverse place, and this is not just an admissions catch phrase. After only 1 year here, I can say I know people from many different racial, religious, political, intellectual, and socio-economic backgrounds and leanings. Diversity at UNC fuels the classroom, the basketball game, the line at Alpine, and the various happenings in the pit. Cutting funding that supports the students of all classes who cannot afford the over 20 or 50k bill (whether in or out of state) would hurt every area of diversity, which would lessen the college experience of every UNC student. The proposition from board member Champ Mitchell that the burden of financial aid has "become unfairly apportioned to working North Carolinians," implying that low income families and students are not "working North Carolinians" is at best absurd. To me, it is disgusting. Does anyone have ideas on how students can take action to stop this? I am currently not in the US, and am very ignorant of the inner political workings of UNC.

Message:Yahoo Small business made sure I never want to use thier web hosting service. They took away a feature that let people with no coding experience work on a website online- simple drag and click stuff, templates- and made it an extra service you have to pay for. Their web hosting is already a little more expensive than web hosting where you need to know how to code. Taking away a feature and then telling you to pay for THE SAME THING- virtually unchanged, I checked- is a real kick between the legs. Don't use yahoo's web hosting if you can avoid it.

Message:I honestly don't get why people think the Star Wars prequels were so bad. I personally thought they were well thought out and symbolic while also tieing perfectly into the originals. The acting was less than fantastic but I blame the editors and writers for making Natalie Portman look bad (Natalie Portman is perfect and any mistake is someone elses fault) . Which lets be honest here: the acting and writing in the first three weren't much better if not worse.

I want to say it was incredible but I feel like I wanna die but I am for some reason happy I saw it, and yeah, fantastic movie. You have to see it. Only once because I don't think anybody could handle going through that experience multiple times without needing to go through therapy for awhile....wow. I just...wow.

Message:The world lost an amazing man today. Robin Williams was a god amongst men in my eyes and he was also one of my biggest inspirations for wanting to become an actor and a comedian. It is something I have always considered. It just sucks that I'll never get to meet him, I guess in the afterlife my dear friend. Your iwork will not be forgotten and your legacy will continue. I pray for his daughter Zelda that she is alright.

Message:Happy Mother's Day to the best mom a kid could ask for!!! You're the strongest and bravest person I know and no matter what, you'll always be incredibly beautiful and smart and sweet because no disease or sickness can ever take that away from you. You're truly an amazing woman and you're my role model. I've had plenty of ups and downs but you've stuck with me through even the toughest times. I am more grateful than words can express for all of your guidance and patience through my rough teen years. You've always been there for me and I know you always will. 

Moms are required to take care of their kids and make sure they stay out of trouble, but you didn't just stop there... you go above and beyond every minute of every day and sacrifice everything for me. You've given me the stars, now all I have to do is take them. You bend over backwards just to see me happy and I hope one day I'll be able to return even just a fraction of the love you've given to me. I am so grateful I was able to spend Mother's Day with you and I wish I could be there with you tomorrow when you start chemo. Just know my heart is right there with you and if I could be there, I would. Stay strong and never forget to smile. 

If you're ever feeling sad, come back and read this message and never forget to be happy and even when it feels hopeless and you've lost the will to be strong, know I'm here to support you and give you my strength. I know you'll overcome this and I can't wait for two years from now to see your beautiful smile as I walk across that stage and receive my diploma. I love you mom and I always will! Happy Mother's Day ??

Message:So we were learning about Long Term Potentiation and memory formation yesterday in physio psych and basically my prof was telling us that this is the reason that silly examples help us remember things--you have a strong connection to something else and then you associate it with the course material and it makes both connections stronger--and during the entire rest of the lecture all I could think was "Fax therefore fax machine therefore torch" and "Carbasus therefore cabbage therefore head therefore sail." Thanks, Gebs! You da best. Now, of course, I'm never going to forget long term potentiation either because I remember those expressions.

This group is to be use for team members to post about team relevant topics (lessons, competitions, questions, etc) and not for solicitation of events. There are other pages for that. If a team MEMBER wants to coordinate a group outing to something then they can post the event to invite others.

Hey everyone, I know it's early still but there is a Standard workshop coming up. Only $10 for students and the instructor, Laura Fan, is new to the area and has expressed interest in coaching us next year. 
It would be great if we could get a group to go and see what her teaching style is like. 
I'm sure carpools can be arranged if needed!

Message:Volunteers needed!! Carmichael community is hosting "Down to Fiesta" this Thursday 7-9pm and would love for us to come out and teach some mini chacha lessons and have some performances intermittently. 
There will be free food and other activities you can explore before/ after your shift. 
The shifts are broken down in the google doc below. I've left room for up to four people per shift and 2 pair to perform every half hour. If you're interested in helping out just write your name and number. 
There's no need to dress up, even if you're performing. Volunteers should wear their Ballroom T-shirt performers can wear whatever they wish. Any level is welcome to perform!!!!

Message:As I mentioned earlier "Healthy Girls Save the World" will be holding a workshop THIS SATURDAY March 29th 10-1 at the Student Union. I'm looking for six dancers (3 guys, 3 girls... preferably partners) at least to  speak with them on the importance of building relationships in dance partnerships and then teach a few simple dance steps (think chacha basic and foxtrot box step). You will only be making a half hour commitment at some point within that time range (the coordinator has not informed me of the slots yet). Please, those who aren't going to nationals this is a great community service opportunity (and participating will really help the team)

To those who say "we don't need feminism anymore": The fact that a women's value is derived primarily from her looks damages self-esteem, prevents them from focusing wholeheartedly on other pursuits, and encourages "catty" behavior rather than sisterhood among women. forreal do

Message:So I got my wisdom teeth taken out today. I was pretty worried about how loopy I would get from the IV sedation knocking me out. But after I regained awareness (at least where my memory begins, anyway), I was told that I had just cried freely after I woke up and had asked to "hug it out" with my beefy nurse guy. Apparently we hugged for like a whole minute. It's mostly just good to know that I don't act all that different with or without the drugs lol...

Message:I love the Duke Lemur Center. Every Wednesday I clean poop and leaves and lemur dishes and chop fruits and vegetables, and it's always worth it to learn something new and unique about a species and to have the chance to observe their interactions. Volunteering here is the best thing I get to do with my time. Maybe one day I'll get to work in lemur conservation in Madagascar.... A girl can dream ?

Message:University of Maryland its hosting its first Major League Hacking sanctioned hackathon this April, and any college student can (and should) come.  Feel free to ask me any questions.

https://bitca.mp/

From the FAQ:
What is a hackathon?
"A hackathon is a creative coding marathon. Students are encouraged to come with an idea, form teams, and then build out that idea into a product in 36 hours. For Bitcamp, we want you to take something you love (sports! art! camping!) and combine it with technology to make something awesome. It is a great time to push the envelope and learn some new skills. Don?t be afraid if you don?t think you have enough experience, a team or an idea. A hackathon is meant for learning and in addition we will help you out."

Sadly, she has recently moved on to another phase in life. If there is a heaven, anyone who knew her will agree with me that she is on her way there now. For those of you who pray, we welcome your prayers. We also welcome everyone's good thoughts. 

Knowing my mom, the "party mom" in elementary school, she would not want you to feel sorrow. She would want you to remember all the good times, and for you to think of those. 

She went peacefully and painlessly, with loved ones surrounding her.

Message:August 30, 2014 was the date. It was a wedding like no other.... 
I've had my own share of weddings both as a guest and as a professional photographer. 
To those who know me well; I don't regularly do weddings not unless you're a cool couple and at least we know each other and shared a few laughs. 
It was a different kind of wedding because it was my little sister Hannah 's big day! 
By default, I was expected to cover the event... It wasn't by choice :P
A few days before the big day it was raining hard all over the metro, but on the day itself there was no trace of rain at all. It was WARM and as if Digo Ricio booked his own SUN to illuminate the set which he provided and that lovely dress which Titser Gabie Osorio made for the bride. 
I was wearing shades during the ceremony and thank God for autofocus because my eyes started to get blurry as I started to cry when I saw my sister walk the aisle. 
I had to man up and switch back to my working mode. Not just covering the ground scene, I had to provide aerial shots as well (bawal ang iyakin during flyouts) where in a few days ago I had a bad crash due to strong radio waves and electro magnetic fields in a powerplant shoot and this was my only available day for a test flight after rebuilding the quad-copter. 
Emotional, lack of sleep and anxiety since i have a 3am flight for Batntayan Island Cebu for a week long documentary project... I was able to go thru the motion and be part of this momentous event in our family and to my sister's. 
I have yet to upload my own photos from the wedding, but for now do enjoy this short video edited and produced by my dear brother Direk Ninja Avid shot by an awesome camera crew who was booked THE NIGHT BEFORE!!!
I'm thank full for my partner in life, my backup and my muse Michelle J. Palijo for helping me keep it together.  
Alex Hornstein, welcome to the family. More adventures to you guys and my soon to be knees (I'm 100% its a girl)!
Sir Donald Hornstein, Mam Amy Sheck and  Eli ... sorry I wasn't able to bond well with you guys but I'm pretty sure we'll be seeing you guys on your shores - soon!   
To my dear parents Alfredo & Norma ... CONGRATULATIONS!

I wrote an academic thesis about ancient Mongolian writing systems so I'm familiar with the formal elements of Mongol bichig but I'm interested now in learning about the artistic techniques, in which I have no experience.  I'd love to find a calligraphy teacher who could offer lessons once or twice a week; I'm fine with lessons conducted in Mongolian or English.  Thanks!

He died for me on that cross at Calvary for all of my sins and didn't give up on me THEN and knowing that gives me confidence, courage, and hope that He will not give up on me NOW. I love Him because He first loved me. I love that He is SO very patient with me and teaches me how to walk with Him every step of the way in this journey of life.

Stockings for Theo and Felix will be arriving shortly too! It's not even the end of September and already I feel so accomplished and ready for the holiday season! Thank goodness for a mother who taught me how to shop as well as getting it out of the way before the holiday rush! All that's left is buying a few gifts for our families, wrapping everything, and decorating for Christmas in a couple of months!

After a lot of consoling and both Geoffrey and I awake trying to help her calm down, we listened to one of her favorite songs and thankfully it aided in calming her! Sophia loves "Christoper Robin" by Kenny Loggins and we love that it helps relax her! She has her sippy cup and Gullah Gullah Island on her tv now so fingers crossed for her to fall asleep!

Message:Friday, we took Sophia to see her pediatrician because she started breaking out with bumps that turned into blisters on her feet, diaper area, and hands. The bumps started and progressed over a 3 day period working their way up. Thankfully, Sophia isn't in too much discomfort but she has been diagnosed with "hand, foot, and mouth." Yesterday, Geoff got the virus too. Poor thing, he was freezing all day, standing on the balcony in the heat with a blanket, long sleeves, and flannel pjs. He had several cups of hot tea and I made him dinner last night that made things a bit better. Today, Mommy is now sick. Go figure. I knew it was only a matter of time since I stay home with Sophia. Lots of sleeping is going to take place today! Thank you to my wonderful husband for watching Sophia and making me something delicious for a late lunch/super early dinner. I'm also happy to say that Sophia will be spending a few days with her Grammy & Grampy this week so Geoff and I can celebrate for our anniversary (July 24)! She always has so much fun with them!

Story:N/A
Message:Ten books that have influenced me, in roughly chronological order:

1. Monster Blood IV, by R.L. Stine -- Still the only book I've stopped reading because I was scared.
2. The View From Saturday, by E.L. Konigsburg -- Narrowly edges out My Side of the Mountain and From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler for best children's book I've read.  The View From Saturday wins out because rather than making me wish I could run away from home, it made me enjoy sitting at home and reading all day.  Also I'm convinced this sowed the seeds of my quizbowl obsession.
3. In Cold Blood, by Truman Capote -- First "adult" book I read.  Somehow managed not to screw me up for life.
4. FreeDarko Presents the Macrophenomenal Pro Basketball Almanac -- aka "why I love the NBA".  Also, it's insane to go back and read this and think about just how much this changed the basketball writing scene.  A stone-cold classic of sports writing.
5. Looking For Alaska, by John Green -- Last YA book I read, and a perfect epitome of the genre.
6. The Glass Menagerie, by Tennessee Williams -- The play that got me into reading plays.
7. White Noise, by Don DeLillo -- Unnerving, comic, and profound all at the same time.  A great introduction to postmodern works and existential dread.
8. The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald -- I will stand by it as the Great American Novel until America is gone.
9. Our Town, by Thornton Wilder -- ?Do any human beings ever realize life while they live it??  Shouts out to Eric Xu for also picking this (he also chose My Side of the Mountain).  
10. Look Homeward, Angel, by Thomas Wolfe -- "And they talked - always they talked, under the trees, against the ivied walls, assembled in their rooms, they talked - in limp sprawls - incessant, charming, empty Southern talk; they talked with a large, easy fluency about God, the Devil, and philosophy, the girls, politics, athletics, fraternities and the girls - My God! how they talked!"

Message:Ashbrook Apartments room open for second summer session (June 18-August 8). You don't have to rent the entire time but that is the biggest window. 

Rent is $120 per week plus utilities. The room is big and furnished with a private bathroom and two closets.

You'll be sharing with me; my roommate is studying abroad for those five weeks. 

Runs off of the J line on Jones Ferry Rd. It's a wonderful apartment with a great kitchen. Washer and dryer included. Less than 2 miles from campus and very close to Carrboro, especially the farmer's market and Carr Mill Shops.

I'm not moving in until May 7, but the apartment is newly refurbished. Here's the link to the site: www.ashbrookcarrboro.com

Story:N/A
Message:I don't usually make political posts but I wanted to throw in my two cents on this. The last few days on campus, there has been a demonstration in the form of a giant photo montage of aborted children. The group argues that abortion is genocide. I have nothing to offer on whether I agree or disagree with their argument, but they ABSOLUTELY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE THERE. It's called free speech people. Yes the images are disturbing and graphic and awful. But that is the reality of abortion. Some think abortion is necessary; others think it's none of their business; still others think it's a crime against humanity. Regardless of what you think about the issue, the reality is that it is an awful, ugly thing. Supporting something without realizing what it really is only shows a willingness to self-desensitize in the name of principled politics. Supporting abortion without realizing what it really is is like supporting war and refusing to see news footage of dead and dying soldiers.

Message:Great news! Cole Simons and I have safely made it to Athens, Alabama. But we're still a little ways off from our ultimate fundraising goal. These funds not only ensure that we can return home safely, but that we can help as many people as possible while we're here. Tomorrow, we're meeting with United Way and will be working with them for the duration of our time here. The most important thing that you can do to help us to give as generously as you can within your means - every $10 goes a long way. Thank you, and we'll keep you updated on our progress!

Message:Thank you to everyone who made this year so special, interesting, and fun. Shoutout to Mason and Trey for putting up with this year, this move, and helping me do whatever this year has brought my way. From Halloween fun with McKenzie, Shelby, De'Shawn, and Brianna, to rushing Franklin with Tyler, Ethan and the boys - I started off the year very different from where I'm ending now. Those were some fun times with Sean, Briana, and the rest of the ROTC middies earlier in the year. Over Christmas break, my family sold our coffeeshop and house, bought an RV, and left me to prosper in Chapel Hill. So - I moved on to pledging AKPsi, and have loved Afika, Ally, Tori, and EVERYONE in RB to death. I'm excited to see what Alpha Sigma Phi has in store for next year, as well. It's a great group of guys, and big plans are in store. In March I took a much needed break from school - and life - with Sarah, Mark and company in OBX for SB2K14 (admittedly, maybe a little too much of a break.) This year I also joined the Camp Kesem staff as a counselor, then as a sub-chair. I can't wait to meet the campers in August, not to mention see Anna, Catherine, Zoe, and everyone else in all their summer glory. 

But in the meantime, I'll be going down to Athens, Alabama tomorrow to assist local authorities with tornado relief efforts with Cole. Afterwards, I'll be working in Chapel Hill for the rest of May and June, before heading off to North Carolina Outward Bound in July. Anyone in Chapel Hill this summer, please hit me up. #keepyikyakstrong. When I get back in August, I'll move into Thug Mansion with Connor, Corey and the boys before having the privilege of photographing my beautiful cousin Karmen's wedding. Thanks again to my fellow Tarheels for making this year great. And thank you in advance for making next year even better.

but first I gotta move all this shit out of my room. 

still a #GDTBATH

It's really sad to see someone who cared about teaching good to kids go and do something that messed up. After watching the video I can understand him being terminated but it's still going to be sad to watch him go. Hopefully he learns a huge lesson and gets whatever help he needs to fix his problems.

Message:Things the kids said to me during my last week at the preschool: 
?I?m going to princess lessons after school!?
?I stomp really hard to scare away bugs. And witches.?
?They?re gonna spank you!?
?Are those tap shoes??
?He?s cute. I?m going to ask him to marry me. I think he?ll say yes.?
?Look at the worm! It?s so cute and squishy!? (It was actually a baby snake and I made her to drop it and run.)
?I love you forever because you let me sit on your lap.?
?Do you get cold because you don?t have any fur on your legs??
?One time I saw an elephant and he scared me so loud!?
?Hey Daddy?..I mean Mommy?..I mean Ava.?
?Jesus kissed me on the cheek!? (I asked a little girl about her birthmark). 
 ?That?s my lipstick. You can try some on if you want.?

I think there?s a lot you can learn about human nature in general from spending a summer teaching and observing a group of preschool-aged children. They are very loving and honest, but sometimes brutally honest, because the normal laws of social interactions do not apply to them just yet. They do not hesitate to tell you what they?re really thinking or feeling, or how they think you?re feeling, or how they feel about you. Unlike adults, they rarely attempt to conceal their emotions. Sometimes when they cry, it?s not so much that they're hurt, it?s more that they need to be reminded that they are cared for and truly loved. They have taught me so much.

Message:Things the preschoolers have said to me recently: 

?That?s my chair! I?m telling on you!? 
?I don?t like him. He?s icky. Boys are icky.?
?There?s nothing to be scared of! It?s just a hair dryer!? (It was a leaf blower)  
?Ooh look! A beaver!? (It was a guinea pig)
 ?This is the Plug to the Universe. If it?s not plugged in, nothing will work, not even BLENDERS.? 
"Come to my birthday party on Saturday. There will be donuts. Okay bye, I love you!"
?Are you afraid of the devil??  
?A fianc?e is Daddy?s really really really good friend.?
?I have sand in my underwear.?
?The fish is sad because she has no one to kiss. She?s all alone. That?s why she swims so slowly.? 
?I really like you and you have to work with me because that?s your job.? 

In conclusion, I really really love these kids.

Message:More of my favorite moments at the preschool: 

During nap time, a little boy offered me his copy of "Amelia Bedelia" to read after I finished "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn". I thanked him for being so thoughtful. 

I was reading to a little boy about a type of turtle that eats mushrooms. He asked me if the turtle eats raw or cooked mushrooms. I asked him who would cook the mushrooms for the turtle and he said that his mom would. Then he told me that his mom cooks mushrooms for him for dinner. And sometimes for dessert. 

Today, a little girl colored half of her picture, then gave it to me as a present and told me that I could "finish it when I got home". 

The teacher was reading a book about dads, and on one page a dad takes his son to visit a farm and teaches his son how to feed the chickens. A little boy in the class randomly yelled out, "Chicken is good! Yummm!" and patted his stomach.  

A little boy asked a girl in the class if she would be his boyfriend. I asked if he meant to say girlfriend and he said yes, and asked her if she would be his girlfriend. She said no and walked away. He looked sort of sad so I patted him on the back and had to stop myself from saying, "It's okay little buddy, you'll find that special someone one day".

Message:Highlights from my first 3 weeks of working at a preschool this summer: 

The kids asked me how old I was and when I said 19, they asked me who's mom I was. I told them that I didn't have any kids and so they asked me if I was a grandma. Then one girl told me that she wants to have 48 kids when she grows up.

This morning, a little girl told me that I smell like cookies. Definitely made my day. 

Two boys looked like they were fighting so I asked them what was going on. When I asked, they stopped and turned to me and smiled and innocently said "We're kissing". I guess they figured kissing was the opposite of fighting. 

Last week when I asked a little girl what she wanted to be when she grew up, she said "NC State".

A little boy had a small cut in the center of his forehead, and when I asked him about it, he said that the cut made him a princess because princesses have a mark in the middle of their foreheads. I'm still confused about this one....

Message:Dad can only give you some advice:  From Lynyrd Skynyrd "Simple Man" song that I used to sing long ago.:
Mama told me when I was young
Come sit beside me, my only son
And listen closely to what I say.
And if you do this
It will help you some sunny day.
Take your time... Don't live too fast,
Troubles will come and they will pass.
Go find a woman and you'll find love,
And don't forget son,
There is someone up above.
[Chorus:]
And be a simple kind of man.
Be something you love and understand.
Baby, be a simple kind of man.
Oh won't you do this for me son,
If you can?
Forget your lust for the rich man's gold
All that you need is in your soul,
And you can do this if you try.
All that I want for you my son,
Is to be satisfied.
[Chorus]
Boy, don't you worry.
You'll find yourself.
Follow your heart,
And nothing else.
You can do this,
If you try.
All that I want for you my son,
Is to be satisfied.
[Chorus]
Baby, be a simple, be a simple man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man

Message:Shout out to Mr. Curtis Jackson Jr. for the nomination to complete the ice bucket challenge!  I appreciate the shade thrown and the opportunity to spread the word.  I am proud to be donating not only to ALS but also supporting Steve Gleason and a fellow Coug by making an additional donation to the Gleason Family Trust to support Steve in his continued his fight with ALS. Thank you for the inspiration! This time around I am going to send it back out West to continue spreading the word and challenging a few former Red Raiders of mine.  First off, my friend and former supervisor Celeste Waugh - I better see all my old boys of Coleman Hall (Jeremy Scot Finch, John Maneno, Joey Buffano, Stephen Schlenker, Ty Vaughn, Trey Hanis, Anthony Tolerton, Braden Russell, Alex Baker, Cody McGill,  Joshua Hutchinson, & Joshua Neel) dumping a huge bucket of ice water all over you as you hold a Vera tote.  Mr. Sean Duggan, I am challenging you to represent the Red Raider family and take a break from opening to accept the challenge.  And lastly, my dear friend Andy Garate, you should have known you were gonna have this sent out your way to Cali.  It's time to accept the challenge and cool off friends! #TarHeels #RedRaiders #GoCougsGo #IceBucketChallenge

As the school year gets closer I've come to the devastating conclusion that, like many of my fellow students, I will have quite a bill for my studies. I'm receiving a few wonderful scholarships, but if anyone has any info as to how I can get a little more help it would be GREATLY appreciated.
Thanks in advance :D

Message:It?s time to set up our weekly meetings for planning HackNC.  Here?s a link to a doodle poll so we can coordinate our schedules.  Choose all the times that work for you and we?ll find a time that works for everyone. (Even though the dates are just for the beginning of August, we?ll use this time throughout the semester.) The meetings shouldn?t go longer than two hours.

Message:Announcements:

I met with a few CS department people today: Missy Wood, Michael Fern, Bil Hays, and Sandra Neely.
1. They're really interested in helping us with reaching out to alumni for donations, setting up catering, organizing facilities, handling money, and just general event planning.

2. Bil is setting up a Google group email so that they can stay up with what we're doing and so that we can ask them for help.

3. The department is hosting a 50th anniversary event two weeks after September 27th and is worried about us making the carpet dirty.  If we promise to be clean we can keep this weekend (I think we should) but if we want to turn the lobby into a pizza-ice-cream-energy-drink-slush pit then we can move the event to October 25th.

4. We have $3000 left over from the spring Hackathon. Michael thinks we should use it to improve the Hackerspace; he doesn't think it's a good idea to save it.

5. Missy suggested a possible theme connection between tools for education and the "computer scientist as a toolsmith" theme of the department's 50th anniversary.  There might be some other connections we could make to differentiate our event from other hackathons.

6. The website is coming along...It'll be done eventually. (Please edit the text in GoogleDrive->Marketing/Website/Copy/)  https://hacknc.github.io/Fall2014

7. Ice cream or energy drinks?

Message:This is important y'all, so please listen up.

First, I need to apologize for dropping the ball as the bus coordinator for Bitcamp and VTHacks. It was my job to get UNC students to go, and that didn't happen.

However, if you're reading this, it means that you have taken on, or are considering taking on, some degree of responsibility for the future of HackNC. Between Bitcamp and VTHacks, we now have a reputation as a big school that can't turn out attendees. VT and UMD were the two most represented schools at HackNC, and we have jeopardized their future attendance by failing to reciprocate with attendees for their events.

The problem does not begin with everyone else, though. It starts with us. Why should the rest of UNC go to hackathons if their leaders do not? Many of you are new, and I don?t hold it against you if you weren't aware of these events. But those of you who helped with HackNC 1 should seriously reevaluate your dedication if you didn't show up to at least one of HackDuke, Bitcamp, or VTHacks. 

While I'm at it, I also have concerns about the marketing of the game theme for HackNC 2. AI, game theory, Oculus Rift, and augmented reality

Message:Happy birthday to my momma, Janet! Thanks for always being there for me. I decided this cheesy Taylor Swift song had the perfect lyrics. This was one of the hardest songs to sing because it really does describe our relationship perfectly. Sorry if my voice sounds weird by the end, I got a little choked up. Anyways. Happy birthday mom, I love you and I'll do whatever I can to make this the best day for you!

Message:Now that I've been challenged twice, I suppose it's time to cave and join in. Michelle Landahl and Samantha Cramer both challenged me to post 5 pictures that I feel beautiful in. I'm not usually a big fan of these chain things, but self acceptance is something I once struggled with, and it was satisfying to look back and see how far I've come. And how many different things I've done to my hair.

I'm not going to challenge anyone in particular, but you should really give it a shot. Even if it's just going through old pictures, with no intent to post them. It's amazing how many memories can float to the surface. Enjoy the nostalgia.

Message:Hello. I have been an aquarist for about 5 years now. It's a little hobby that I enjoy that helps relieve some stress. For the first 2 years, I've only had artificial plants in my tank. After graduating high school, I wanted to upgrade into a planted freshwater tank. I've made a lot of mistakes, but several things have been learned in the process. Plants are definitely much harder to take care of than fish, but the outcome can sometimes be rewarding. Other times, it's just frustrating. The pictures included in this album only represent the 5th year of taking care of the tank and onwards with the exception of the first picture.The point of this album is to simply serve as a timeline of my fish tank. I would like to look back in how well I've taken care of my fish tank and how much it's changed.

My favorite bible passage, or at least one I keep coming back to, is: "My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you, turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding, and if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding, and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as hidden treasure, then you will understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God." -Proverbs 2:1-5

Glo, Laura, and Kristen; please accept this nomination if you choose!

Also, I want to see you at least once when I am back home for a couple of days in the middle of August, so we should try to figure that out as well ;)

Name:The horrors driving thousands of Central American kids to take the dangerous journey to the U.S.
Story:N/A
Message:With a topic as politically charged as immigration, I think it's easy to reduce it to just that: politics. But doing so obscures the stories behind the issue. Stories of human beings experiencing pain and suffering, risking everything because everything is already at risk.

I think as a country, we like to view ourselves as the "do-gooders" of the world, but the way we have treated migrants from Latin America shows how cold our hearts really are. Because in such a grand opportunity to show compassion to the poor, tired, and huddled masses, we have instead chosen hostility, disdain, and hate. 

Furthermore, what is it that we think about when we hear the term "American"? Whether Chinese, Japanese, Black, Eastern European, Jewish, Irish, Roman Catholic or Protestant, all of these and more are the threads of the American fabric. But we forget that 50, 75, or 100 years ago these groups were part of immigration waves that were met with just as much hostility as the wave we experience today. Likewise, we can predict that in 25 years people of latin descent will have become just as integral to our culture as the rest of us, and the US will be stronger and more vibrant as a result, just as has happened with each wave of immigration in our history. 

Lastly, we shouldn't be so afraid of change in our country, because changing is the only thing we've ever done. And after all, Frozen teaches us to embrace change, not fear it.

The most talented cast I've ever worked with - without each and every one of YOU, who knows where we'd be? This certainly doesn't feel like student theater anymore, and to anyone on the fence about coming, let me assure you right here and now that the feeling (the feeling that this is bigger and better than anyone ever thought possible) translates 100% to the audience. This production will blow your mind; I am beside myself with pride to have worked with such an incredible cast and crew.

Message:I want to thank everyone who has given my family love and support during the last week. My grandfather had a young soul, and if not for his fall, I know we'd have had him for another ten years. But life happens, and all we can do is be thankful for the years we spent with him.

Our gratitude for your thoughts cannot be expressed in words, and neither can our love for our grandfather. He has taught me the importance of loving life, loving your family with all your heart, and approaching life with unwavering positivity. D lives on in the kindness and gratitude he taught us to express toward others. So in honor of D, I sincerely thank you for the kindness you have shown my family.

Message:Video games are not my usual favorite activity, but this one is worthy of interest from both the biggest players in the world and those who have never picked up a controller. It's a new take on war games that is non-violent and instead focuses on the real stories and complex conflicts of the many people affected by war - perhaps an important potential step in changing the way we think about and engage with war itself. Consider supporting this game and making its further development possible so that game players have a chance to go beyond the two dimentional world of shooter games and begin to interact with and understand the deeper conflicts and interactions of war.

Message:My time here on Maui has been full of ups, downs, adventures, and sights that I still can?t believe I?ve seen. However, I must report with only a small, doubtful hint of sarcasm that perhaps the most crucial moment of my summer happened tonight. I?m usually not afraid of spiders, but the size and especially the speed of this (harmless) cane spider and another like it that I met my first week here have had me immobilized with fear and even exiled from my own bedroom. Tonight, with a little bit of guts and a lot of divine intervention in the form of animal behavior science, I was able to capture this fellow and release him into the wild. Not only will I sleep in my bed tonight instead of on the couch, but I will also sleep the sound slumber of a champion.

Story:N/A
Message:Something that has been really frustrating to me lately is how different modern American Christianity often looks from Jesus' message of love, justice, and refusing to accept the status quo (even if the status quo here seems better than it is in some places). The movement to change this team's name isn't one I know much about, but I'm encouraged to see Christians acting on the belief that Jesus didn't come to make us feel better about how the world is and how we live in it, but rather to make us realize how much work we have left to do to start living the way we were meant to.

Hey guys! I just want all of you to know that I am thinking about and praying for each of you and everyone else going on the trip and for everyone you come into contact with. Debbie and Catie, I am so excited for you guys to be able to go again, I remember both of you telling me about it last year before you left and seeing how excited you guys were not knowing the impact it would have on your lives. Stephen, I know how pumped you are to go go this year and I don't think that it is any coincidence that you are going and that timing worked out; God definitely intended for you to go on this trip. You guys are going to amazing things while you are there. I can't wait to hear about your experiences and how you saw God and how He worked in you and through you. You guys are truly amazing and wonderful and I love each of you more than you know. Safe travels to all of you! God Bless You! :)

Message:Unforgettable is the only way to describe my experience at #artRaveDC. I won 2 VIP tickets as the grand prize winner in the #AbsolutGaga contest. Thanks to Absolut, I got to meet and dance with Lady Gaga's mother and sister in the VIP ABSOLUT ARTPOP Lounge during the concert. Such a sweet and lovely family. Lady Gaga talked directly to me during the show. She commented about how sweaty it must be in my costume since she was so sweaty in her latex suit. I made some amazing new Monster friends. I also made a lot of people happy by taking pictures with them since everyone loved my costume! All alongside the best boyfriend ever, Andrew Wood. I will never stop working hard because dreams do come true and hard work always pays off. Paws up!

1) How are objects laid out in memory?
2) How would you implement inheritance in memory (think about how C++ has virtual methods)
3) What problems occur with multiple inheritance? How would you lay that out in memory optimally?

Message:"Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lies comes to such a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love. And in order to distract himself without love he gives way to passions and coarse pleasures and sinks to the beastiality of his own vices-- all this from continual lying to other men and to himself."

Name:NOVA | Working With Infinity
Story:N/A
Message:Well, infinity is also problematic because it seems to be more than anything, and for this reason it is something that you will never reach. That's the famous paradox. How will you ever get from Point A to Point B if there are infinitely many things along the way? To get from A to B, you would first have to reach half the way. But to reach half the way, you'd first have to reach half of half the way, and then to get there, you'd have to reach half of the half of the half, and so on. It would appear that you would never be able even to make a start. There are always stages along the way that you haven't reached. If things can be divided into infinitely many stretches along the way, then there is simply no way you will ever cross from one point to another.

Basically, then, the problem seems to be that whatever we're doing getting from one place to another, counting things, doing things, we're doing finite things. We're running a stadium track in two minutes; we're counting, let's say, within the range of a single book; we're making a computation on a piece of paper. We've got something finite to work with. How can anything finite encompass within it something that is infinite in character? So this seems to be another major problem.

The most talented cast I've ever worked with - without each and every one of YOU, who knows where we'd be? This certainly doesn't feel like student theater anymore, and to anyone on the fence about coming, let me assure you right here and now that the feeling (the feeling that this is bigger and better than anyone ever thought possible) translates 100% to the audience. This production will blow your mind; I am beside myself with pride to have worked with such an incredible cast and crew.

Message:To my friends at UNC who have cars, can someone so me a HUGE favor. I need to pick up a prescription and it is at a compounding pharmacy far down franklin street. Can someone drive me there so I can pick it up before 5pm (pharmacy closes at 5). I would bike there but I just got my ingrown toenail cut out and can't bike 5 miles there and back. I would be so so very appreciative!

Message:Positivity challenge (day 3 of 3):
I'm thankful for:
1) Food and Drink. I will admit that I am completely spoiled when it comes to access to food at home and at UNC. At the dining hall I can eat until my belly is full, or rather bursting... At home food is something that I have always had access to and more if it was desired. I am so grateful for always be able to eat and drink.
2) Music. I love singing and listening and dancing to it. It brings me an immense amount of joy!   
3) People in general. As an extrovert, I am recharged from others and so thankful for all the amazing people I know and on this earth in general. 

I want to invite (invite not challenge because there is no pressure here) Tyler Fredricks, Ishmael Bishop, and Nicol?s C. Merritt to do the gratitude/positivity challenge where you post 3 things you're thankful for, for 3 days in a row, and each day to invite 3 other people.

Message:Positivity challenge (day 2 of 3):
I'm thankful for:
1) My health and more specifically being able to work out. Six months ago I could barely walk and had difficulty lifting my backpack. It was a really scaring time period, but it was a humbling experience because I know how lucky and privileged to be in general good health. Six months ago I could barely walk, and now I hope to run a half marathon is Fall. I am so thankful everyday for this
2) My amazing family. I could write pages and pages of information about why I am thankful for my family. They all are so incredible and so thankful that they are a part of my life. From my crazy, little, Frozen-loving (like the movie) niece to my very generous and adorable grandma, I am so blessed to have them.
3) For having the privilege of having a basic education, as well as getting a higher level of education at a University I love. I am not saying UNC is the best, because best is all based on opinion, but UNC is the best fit for me. So thankful to be here and studying areas that interest me!

I want to invite (invite not challenge because there is no pressure here) my sweet aunt Cindy Schneider, Robyn Gardner, and Sammy Chavin to do the gratitude/positivity challenge where you post 3 things you're thankful for, for 3 days in a row, and each day to invite 3 other people.

I'm grateful for:
1) Waking up every morning. One of the easiest things to take advantage but it is an amazing miracle everyday.
2) Glennda Campbell and Metzli Rodoli because they brighten up my day whenever I see them and they also showed me that just because we are juniors doesn't mean we can't meet new amazing friends!
3) The incredible staff I work with in Kenan community! Everyone is so great and pleasant to be around. It makes walking around the community a glorious experience. Remember, Team Kenan Stays Dreaming! 

I want to invite (invite not challenge because there is no pressure here) Katie Petry, Yusuf Amir, and Liz Reeder to do the gratitude/positivity  challenge.

Hamas has demonstrated over and over again that they are nothing besides pure evil, and I know Israel will do what it needs to do to crush them and restore the peace, while minimizing civilian casualties and helping the wounded (as they always have). Good luck to you and to your people in the days ahead.

Message:Hey Tatyana! So I think I may have already asked about this last summer, but I'm thinking about taking BIOL 410 (principles of teaching methods in biology) next semester.  I know you said it was a good class, but I was just wondering about the volunteer component.  I found an old syllabus that says you had "the opportunity" to volunteer in high schools every week.  Did you volunteer each week?  What exactly did you do?  Were you expected to drive yourself to the schools? 
Thanks! And I hope you're doing well!

TA: If I could have any superpower, I would have the ability to materialize food right in front of me, already prepared.

Professor: That's called having a wife.

I know I don't say this enough but I love you guys and I appreciate everything you do. You have always been there for me through thick and thin and in every way possible. From giving me advice, to picking me up from school, and even threatening to beat people up for me! :) Even though I can be the annoying little sister at times, i know you love me unconditionally. I have been truly blessed with the most amazing siblings in the world. I just wanted to take this time to thank you for never letting me down. I love you guys with all of my heart and I am so grateful to have brothers like you! <3

Message:Every time someone passes away, we always say how loved and appreciated they were. We talk about  how they touched our hearts and how much they will be missed, but it shouldn't take a tragedy to bring out these feelings. We should tell our friends and family how important they are every day. We should make sure that they know how much we cherish them. If you're reading this post, all i ask is that you tell someone how much they mean to you. Let them know that you care. It could be just what they needed to hear. :) I love you guys, thank you for always being there for me!

Message:Wow okay, do I have to be sappy and write on your wall for your birthday? It's not like you're the sugar to my tea or anything, that would be totes weird. KIDDING. Aren't you so glad you met me in Tamil class back in the day when I was probably that weird kid who was trying to figure out how to spell all the bad words? Actually no, that was probably what those fobby boys were doing... ANYWAY, welcome to officially being old!!! Happy birthday Aditers, love ya roomz :) Also, I have another surprise so you better be home later!

This summer is gonna be sweet! I love this guy, always visiting me on my breaks at work and bringing me food, and always having mini dates between our busy schedules. He always tries to make time for me, fishing in the mornings! Helping me shop for makeup even though he doesnt want me to wear any lol him picking out my outfits and me picking his lol calling each other at night and fall asleep on the phone with, carrying me when i hurt myself (which is often). Ahhhh i can go on about this guy. But he really has my heart. He knows how to make his girlfriend feel special. I am so blessed. I don't normally go on about someone like this but David isn't just someone, he is my best friend, the cream to my coffee, the jake to my finn, the sam to my frodo. I dig him lol So there facebook lol just thought I should put that out there. For a relationship to work, God is first. And honestly, I've never been happier!

Message:Loling at people hating on couples today. Seriously??? Saying things like how much money they are saving, less drama, how every guy/girl is the same, and they don't need anyone to be happy. One part is true. You don't need anyone to be happy. Be happy with yourself, if you aren't a happy soul then don't get in a relationship and ruin the other persons happiness. Money shouldn't be an issue anyways. And with the drama part, just stay away from it. How hard is that. And no, not every guy and girl is the same, maybe you should just focus on yourself and be a better person and maybe you will attract someone worth while. Remember, you have a beautiful soul and you will find the right person. Stop getting discouraged, just focus on you, and the right one will come along!

In reality, the peak is on the left of the painting as seen by the viewer. I have officially started to see everything in stage directions. -.- I think it is time for spring break now.

I want to start by thanking all of the little people...wait a minute, this is not a speech...and i dont know any little people...but now on a more relevant topic, happy birthday babe.  You are officially 21 now and I feel so young cause you are essentially 2 years older than me now.  But congratulations on your accomplishment...I am very proud that u have made it this far...I was rooting for you the whole way...well since I knew you so the last 4ish years.  But anyway.  Happy Birthday :D

Won this from the lottery at Gamefest.  Once again, big shoutout to Ubisoft at UNC Chapel Hill for providing us with the Two games + Life sized Black Flag for Lottery and for other swag goodies.

Max Daum should be receiving his copy of Rayman Legends for Ps4 very shortly :).

Be sure to visit the Ubisoft page and give them an add for chances at some sweet free stuff.

After meeting with the Jade (the CS department Career Service Representative), we have decided to do some collaboration between the CS Club, and career services. Jade is holding a technical interview overview workshop on Monday Oct 1st. I was wondering if anyone was willing to serve on a panel to discuss their experiences with technical or behavioral interviews. Email me at (rramkuma at live.unc.edu) if you are interested.

Message:So, I received an email from a student at UNC Charlotte asking about buses for HACK NC. Shown below:

I have been talking to my friend about the Hackathons you guys have (yearly ones I believe?). He said that you guys have buses that drive to other schools. I was wondering what the requirements would be to get a bus to come to UNC Charlotte. I understand that the next Hackathon isn't completely set in stone. If I am not emailing the correct person, could you please direct me to the right place.

Any thoughts on how we should respond to this?

Message:"When we plant a rose seed in the earth, we notice that it is small, but we do not criticize it as "rootless and stemless." We treat it as a seed, giving it the water and nourishment required of a seed. When it first shoots up out of the earth, we don't condemn it as immature and underdeveloped; nor do we criticize the buds for not being open when they appear. We stand in wonder at the process taking place and give the plant the care it needs at each stage of its development. The rose is a rose from the time it is a seed to the time it dies. Within it, at all times, it contains its whole potential. It seems to be constantly in the process of change; yet at each state, at each moment, it is perfectly all right as it is." - W.

I have two showers. One is only producing cold water. The other is now only producing scalding hot water. It is a little chilly out. What kind of a choice is this.

Message:America. Thankyou for undoubtedly the greatest year of my life. I am finally home after 13 months away in the states, and everyone that I have met, every place travelled and every experience had has culminated in the most breathtakingly wonderful year. I have met best friends, kind-hearted peopl and a vast smorgasbord of personalities. I have been to 24 states. I have couchsurfed around America and Canada. Mardi Gras. Spring Break. Couchsurfing. Hostels. So many great cities, states and locations. I joined a fraternity, and was lucky enough to meet some great and fantastic ATO's. Thankyou to every person I worked with on plays. To all of the grotto. To everyone working at Linda's. To every single American. Your kindness, joy de vivre and stories have continually astounded me and nourished my experience in your country. Saying goodbye to you was the hardest thing of all. Forever a Tar Heel. Thankyou <3

 "how do you know if the focus of study is a group or individual? If it focuses on a group, then it's a group. If it focuses on an individual, then it's an individual." 
Thank you book, I don't think I would have ever figured that one out.
Oh, and also: "Characteristics that vary are called variables." Whhaaaaaa...?

Message:Ok, I wasn't really going to do this, but I feel like I need to so that everyone is on the same page.

I don't really know anyway to ease into this, so here goes: I'm Bisexual. Yes, I'm attracted to both men and women. 

That's the important part of this post. The rest is just some more information for the curious.  If my sexuality bothers you, then I'm extremely sorry, but there's nothing I can do about it. 

Back when I left school last fall, one of the things I decided to do to make myself feel better was come out. I came out to my family (who are all super supportive and awesome!), and I've been trying to come out to my friends. I wanted to do this in person though, because... well, I don't know, it just seemed more personal that way. However, that was taking too long for many reasons, and there's already been confusion among some friends as to who knows and who doesn't, so I felt the need to make one of these posts.  I'm super sorry if I didn't get the chance to tell you in person! Please don't take it personally if I haven't told you in person, I have a very hard time finding the appropriate point in conversation to bring it up. I'm more than happy to talk about it with anyone that has questions though!

Message:Bad news everyone.

Due to certain, unfortunate circumstances, I?m taking leave from UNC. I won?t be finishing this semester, and I won?t be coming back next semester. But who knows! I might be back next year though! And I?ll come up and visit every now and again this semester at the very least!

I?ve been trying to see as many people as possible so I could tell you all in person, but I?ve realized I?ve made a lot of friends this past two and a half semesters, and it?s been impossible to see all of my awesome friends! 

If ?You don?t know how many friends you have until you have to leave them? isn?t already a saying, it should be.

Anyway, I?m moving out tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow. It?s been that sudden.

So, tomorrow, while I?m packing, I?m going to have my door open. If I didn?t get a chance to say good bye to you in person, then PLEASE feel free stop by Cobb 111 while I?m packing, and we can have a heart to heart.

Again, I?m REALLY sorry if I didn?t get to see and tell you in person, but if I didn?t, then please come over sometime tomorrow, sometime between 10:30-4, so we can say good bye!

You've grown so much that I literally look up to you (when/how did that happen...) but I'm sOOOOOO excited that Isabella Kim and I get to spend your birthday twiht you since we have spring break.  Lovely just how that all works out.  I miss you and mommy so much so I'm so glad we can spend your birthday and stuff together :) Meanwhile, enjoy this personalized birthday song.

Message:Yes, this right here. The US terrorism against black and brown bodies is outrageous and I am exhausted from explaining to white folks why these stories break me and how racist oppression manifest in my life. I make no apologies when I wonder why a black man must be dressed in a white man's uniform of education and employment for the world to give a damn! Mothers of color doubt if they are able to protect their sons and daughters from these acts of calamitous violence. This is not just a race issue, this is a reproductive justice issue, this is a feminist issue, this is everyone's issue.

Message:Tell Michael Brown, who was moments away from beginning college, that it's not about RACE. Tell John Crawford, who was moments away from becoming a father, it's not about RACE. Tell Oscar Grant and Sean Bell who were moments away from marriage, that it's not about RACE. Tell Trayvon Martin who was moments away from home, it's not about RACE. Tell Darius Simmons, Rekia Boyd, and Renisha McBride who were moments away from living a full life, that it's not about RACE. 

Tell me, it's not about RACE, when everyday I fear someone who looks like me, being shot and killed. PTSD, no longer applies to my generation of young, black American Millennials, because we must live in persistent fear of profiling, discrimination, misrepresentation, false allegations, and violence against our community. Talking about these issues and being clear about the way in which RACE is constant in my life should be encouraged and never silenced. Using whatever space I occupy to discuss my learned and lived experience should be supported by allies and not oppressed. Making everyone around me uncomfortable is my responsibility to this movement, this cause and this lifetime. #NoJusticeNoPeace

Message:I read about this nonsense this morning, but you know it'll be close to pulling teeth for some white folks to admit to their racial privilege despite profit making apps like this being in existence. God forbid, a black American makes an app that shares geographic locations of the KKK or confederate sympathizers. I'm sure the logic is that avoiding white supremacy is unconstitutional.

Message:?Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won?t either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could.? -Louise Erdrich, The Painted Drum

Message:MUSIC LOVERS/FILM GEEKS/NORTH CAROLINIANS:

I'm bringing Sofar Sounds to the triangl--a group that organizes local shows (fo' free) for an intimate crowd in homes. I'll need a team though. So, if you're interested in being part of this awesome movement, check out the positions I'm looking for:

City Co-Leader: (Communicates with HQ, Oversee city operations)
Guest List/Fan Communication: (Support, will communicate with attendees)
Booking Acts/A&R: (Searches for fresh emerging talent)
Audio and Video Manager: (Communicates with your sound engineers and film/photo crew)

Also, if you DON'T want to be a manager of any sort, but DO want to be involved in one of the four areas listed above, we can work something out.

Spread the word.

Hit me up at if you're bold enough to take on this. BTW, Not a paying gig--just doing it for the music.

You are going to love it! Just promise to come back to the States! You better be taking millions of photos because I want a full recap of it when you get back.  Safe travels and found this on buzzfeed for when you are in Berlin.  

P.S. next time you are taking me backpacking with you.... I'm thinking after we graduate.

Message:I just saw the Alert Carolina email about a reported sexual assault that happened at like 8 this morning. Here I was thinking some poor girl had something awful happen to her in broad daylight on campus. I get to the end of the report after a lengthy description of the guy that did something to her and then it says all he did was slap her on the butt and run...Really? Yes, I understand if you were upset. I'd be a little freaked, but I feel like this was a bit of an overreaction.

Btw, a friend of ours (who doesn't know you, but was present at your high school graduation) randomly said the other day: "I heard the prettiest name I have ever heard a couple of years ago."  And proceeded to tell us your name.  This after I asked him if he has thought about what to name his future children. So there ya go, you have a beautiful name!

Message:Hi David A. Johnston,

As Ron Gross already told you in an email to the both of us, I am interested in betting that Mastercoin's value will be lower in six months than now. Ron said you're interested in taking that bet.

This started as a response to a post by someone on the Israeli Mastercoin group on facebook here:

https://www.facebook.com/groups/btcil/permalink/596260720453660/?comment_id=599044870175245&offset=0&total_comments=91
 
Sadly (for democracy and freedom of speech), the guys there kinda got tired of the crossfire, and asked to stop the thread, so I'm continuing it here. Hopefully people here can stand the heat better.

I am deliberately posting this bet on facebook (and not through the email), because the purpose of this bet is *not* to win or lose BTC, it is to make a point that *IMO* Mastercoin is a SCAM and I hope all MSC holders sell it ASAP.

The reason I think Mastercoin will fail is because of the incompetent and scandalous management of the project. Specifically J.R Willet.

I hope to bring enough attention and ask enough tough questions so that people see the light as to what might be going on behind the scenes.

My main concern is that there is a clear conflict of interest between J.R and the Mastercoin project and holders.

J.R. is the trustee of 4100 plus BTC (according to this google doc:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtCyUJvk_IyNdGpVcnpBN2tOczFmbVRnck5TWjZuRFE&usp=sharing#gid=0 ).

Whether MSC succeeds or fails does not change J.R's holding of these BTC.

So I ask a simple question. What incentive is there for J.R to make MSC succeed?

Well... obviously, as the largest MSC holder, it would be a big advantage to him. So that's his incentive. No doubt there *is* incentive for him to make it succeed.

However, well... if it fails, most (or some) of the 4k+ btc would still be there. So he could also actually choose to do nothing to promote the project, and just "sit" on those btc, and wait for the project to die. Maybe, just maybe, no-one would complain, and he could just walk away with the money.

That's a pretty good return for a whitepaper and some bitcointalk post.

So he has the choice. Work hard to make it succeed, or do nothing, let it die, and get a few million bucks' worth of BTC.

From the way the project has been managed so far, I am willing to bet that Willet prefers it to die, and I'm willing to put my BTC where my mouth is.

So I am re-posting my proposal for a bet that I originally posted in the thread above:

bet 1:
I am willing to bet 1 BTC that the 60-day-moving-average OR the average of the last 1000 trades, OR trading volume of 1000 BTC (whichever of the three is the the longer time period or higher volume), from the "last trades" on this page

https://www.masterxchange.com/market.php

will be lower on August 2nd 2014 at 19:44:00 PM GMT+2 than it was on Feb 2nd 2014 at 19:44:00 PM GMT+2

We can use this site for the historic data:

http://www.cryptocoincharts.info/v2/pair/msc/btc/masterxchange

(we'll use their API to do the exact calculation)

bet 2:

I am also willing to bet 1 BTC, with 100-1 odds that - at no instance until August 2nd 2014 at 19:44:00 PM GMT+2, the 60-day-moving-average OR the average of the last 1000 trades (whichever is the longer time period), OR trading volume of 1000 BTC (whichever of the three is the the longer time period or higher volume) from bet 1 - be higher than what it was on Feb 2nd 2014 at 19:44:00 PM GMT+2.

(I hope I'm stating the odds correctly. What I mean by "100-1" is that if I win, I get 100 BTC, if I lose, I lose my 1 BTC).

There are three possible scenarios:

1- I lose both bets (MSC is higher at the end and possibly before that)
2- I lose bet 2 but win bet 1 (MSC does go higher during the six months, but is lower at the end)
3- I win both bets (MSC remain lower throughout and at the end)

There is no way I can lose bet 1 and win bet 2 (if MSC is higher at the end then I automatically also lose bet 2). So anybody who's willing to take bet 1, should also be interested in bet 2. The reason I choose 100-1 odds, is to gauge the taker's confidence in the project, and to convey a message to the rest of the readers.

David, you up for it? Any other takers other than David?

Message:Woke up this morning to discover that the ceiling in the apartment was leaking in about seven different places. The maintenance guy told me it was because of the dishwasher in the apartment above us leaking. We've always been able to hear our upstairs neighbors walking around and when I asked him how they didn't notice it was leaking so much he informed me that NO ONE LIVES UP THERE!!

Turns out they moved out a few days ago. But still my heart stopped for a minute when he said that, especially considering we always make jokes about how loud the ghosts above us are. But now I get to spend my day listening to water drip into buckets.

I feel that sometimes many people get so caught up in the rights and wrongs and rule following and drawing lines between the various sects of Christianity that we forget that we're all serving the same God, and that that God said that the most important thing we could do was show compassion and love to everyone, not condemn people we believe are wrong.

 Alas. I do hope they put that wonderful new dressing on my salad tonight...named after me, of course."

Message:I'm home, but let me make a memory on the wall. This summer was my second one in Wildwood. I met bunch of great people, who made my summer better than I expected. It's tough to say how much I gonna miss those days, when I was there. How much I gonna miss my roommates and that mess in kitchen and getting up early for diving in Ocean Oasis or Raging Waters. I gonna miss my friends who are spread all over the world. I never forget those stories, which happened there, my 23rd birthday and the night after. Never forget my baes, who will come to visit me, I believe really soon. Last couple days was hard for me to say see you Wildwood, even if I don't know if I'll ever come back again. At this moment I know that down there across the ocean I have a lot of great friends and I will see all of them.  Now I know that I would rather be down there. But for this moment I belong here, I have many things to do. I promised to visit my Spanish friends in Madrid, where I will want to go. And then my dear Americans I'll come to visit You! Till those days, see you.... 
P.S.: Picture is not perfect, but who is ;)

Message:3 years ago today after a movie we went up on the parking deck in Biltmore Park and you asked me to be your girlfriend. And Drew , I'm so glad you did because this has been the most incredible 3 years of my life. We've been through so much together, and if I had to do it over, I'd choose you, again and again. You are my best friend and so much more and I love you more than words could ever explain. You make everything better and I'm so thankful that you are a part of my life. There's no one else I could even fathom being with other than you. I love you with all of my heart, forever and always! Happy 3 year anniversary baby! ??

Message:I wanted you to see this after our conversation. It is from Psalm 139:13-16.

13 For you created my inmost being;
    you knit me together in my mother?s womb.
14 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made;
    your works are wonderful,
    I know that full well.
15 My frame was not hidden from you
    when I was made in the secret place,
    when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.
16 Your eyes saw my unformed body;
    all the days ordained for me were written in your book
    before one of them came to be.

Message:Katie, your mother and I realize we promised we'd go to that fair with you tonight. But with all the storms around, we're going to stay at home. We both know you're old enough to venture out on your own now and you don't need us to hold your hand or help put you on the rides. But of course, if you fall off a ride, please shoot a selfie so we can have a laugh!  :)

Love ya!!

We've known each other for something like eight years now. It's safe to say that you know me better than anyone else, and I could not be who I am today without your love and support. You are the greatest best friend I could ever ask for. You deserve whatever good comes your way. ALSO, CONGRATS ON FINISHING CHEM 101 WAAAHOOOOO!!! I look forward to spending many more years with you and seeing what kinds of shenanigans we get ourselves into. I love you, Christy Pisty! Happy birthday! <3

Message:Tough day. Exposing emotions to those important to me is a vulnerability that I greatly desire, but yet seems so unachievable. It is clear to me that I don't know how. I guess a good place to start is discover why a paralyzing wall of fear hits me when I am faced with expressing my feelings towards someone else. I'm open to anyone's thoughts or comments.

Message:So far, I'm loving college.  But my dorm is...not ideal.  It's on the far side of campus from most classes, it's rooms are smaller than standard jail cells, the drum line practices RIGHT outside the dorm, there is no air conditioning, and my floor is filled with jocks.  Everyone always offers their condolences when I tell them I'm in Gardner...  But my classes rock!

Message:Candlelight Vigil for Dr. Feng Liu at Global FedEx Center. 

As you may know, Dr. Liu was beaten and robbed on University Drive at 1pm after lunch one day, a road very close to campus that many students, professors, and staff leisurely walk on during various parts of the day. Dr. Liu died from his wounds.

Many friends, colleagues, neighbors, and members of the community attended candlelight vigil, even at a late notice of a few days. It was touching to see so many faces and heart-breaking to hear different speeches and tributes to Dr. Liu.

Everyone, please be safe where ever you are, no matter how often you have been there before. It really is important that you don't walk around at night alone. Even during broad daylight in a comfortable area, you do need to be aware of your surroundings. My thoughts go out to Dr. Liu's family and friends. ?????????.

Message:It's so hard to believe that 2 years ago today I was in the middle of my first full day as a resident of JMU. I wasn't sure how I was going to make friends or make this place my home. Two years later, I'm on the other side of things, watching my 22 girls learn to navigate the campus and build relationships with each other, and I couldn't be prouder of them. I can't wait to see where this year takes us :)

You've got the "why do you want to be a doctor?" response 100% ! ^_^ I can't wait until I am in your position. I wish you the best of luck! And I'm praying for you.

Message:"A large number of American teenagers live exactly like Michael Brown. 

Very few of them are shot in the head and left to bake on the pavement. 

The ?angelic? standard was not one created by the reporter. It was created by a society that cannot face itself, and thus must employ a dubious ?morality? to hide its sins. 

It is reinforced by people who have embraced the notion of ?twice as good? while avoiding the circumstances which gave that notion birth. 

Consider how easily living in a community ?with rough patches? becomes part of a list of ostensible sins. 

Consider how easily ?black-on-black crime? becomes not a marker of a shameful legacy of segregation but a moral failing.?

????? ????? ????? ???? ? ????? ???????

If you are unable to figure this out, I must assume that I have been right all along: Your real name is Carlota Velasquez; you crossed the border illegally and you took on your Indian persona in order to qualify for more cardiac bioengineering scholarships. 

Side note: ? This is my favorite Malayalam character -- it looks like a little pig.

Side note #2: I love you, Smrithi FREAKIN' Valsaraj!

Message:All kidding aside though, volunteering at the hospital in Lillington has absolutely been one of the greatest things I've ever done. I've only volunteered for four days now, and it's been fantastic, especially since they've been letting me do patient rounds throughout the entire hospital. Even though they don't pay me for being up there, of course, there really hasn't been a minute that I haven't wanted to spend at the hospital, even if they only allow me to do basic stuff. I don't what this means, but considering the compliments/advice I've gotten from the nurses and physicians at the hospital, some serious changes might be on the way. There's a large part of the summer left, so we'll see!

Message:Visited the Hill of Crosses last weekend in Northern Lithuania which contains over 500,000 crosses.  During the Soviet occupation, the Hill was bulldozed seven times but the Lithuanians continuously planted crosses as a symbol of religious protest under the oppression and some even died doing so.  It's very moving to think just how powerful religion can be.

Message:I was tagged by Shiaomeng Tse to post five pictures that make me feel beautiful.  But since beauty is social construct, I, like my friend Alex, am going to post five pictures where I'm happy.  I'd like Cubby Warren, Allison Bossie, JP Rickabaugh, Kevin Chen, and Tillypoo T-Bird Swagmaster the Jimmy- Russell to do the same.

I ended the week with a day trip to Brighton on Saturday and church at St. Paul's Cathedral this morning, as well as an afternoon visit to the Tate Modern museum. So, so blessed to have the opportunity to take part in this adventure.

Message:Well, my Friday the 13th was certainly eventful with me getting into a car accident. I wasn't seriously hurt from the wreck (just some bruising from my seatbelt) but it was definitely the most terrifying situation I have ever been in. I'm so grateful God was protecting me and my guardian angel was with me. A few inches farther up and the impact could have seriously hurt me. My car might be totaled which is heartbreaking but as long as I walked away from the accident, I am blessed and happy. As my mom and grandma said, cars can be replaced, people can't.

David Heath as Stanley Ipkiss/The Mask
Destinee Whitaker as Stephanie Ipkiss
Joey Welch as Harry Ipkiss
Katie Miller as Tina Carlyle

(Our story continues with the our characters getting home. Stanley was nervous, he hadn't seen Tina in years.)

Stanley: Here we go.

Harry: Don't worry, you got this pop.

Stanley: Don't call me that.

(Stephanie walks through the door, and sees her mom in the kitchen.)

Stephanie: Mom?

Tina: Hi honey, how was your sleep over?

Stephanie: Well actually mom, I didn't go to a sleepover and neither did Harry.

Tina: Then where were you exactly?

Harry: We went looking for someone, and we found him.

(Stanley walks up, Tina is speechless.)

Stanley: Hi Tina.

Tina: What are you doing here?

Stephanie: Mom, you need to make things right with dad.

Tina: Stephanie I told you time and time again, I will be fine. Why did you agree to this?

Stanley: Their my kids and I never met them, why do you think I agreed to this?

Tina: You know you would have been there for their birth if...

Stanley: If you hadn't been cheating on me? Yes your right.

Tina: You still have that hanging over my head?

Stanley: Of course I do. You broke my heart Tina, and more importantly what hurt me most is what you said when I left, remember? I know you do. What did you say?

Tina: "I prefer the mask."

Stanley: Yes.

Harry: Look we are all a little bit steamed so why don't we just cool off.

(After a long day, Stanley stayed at a hotel to prevent any and all awkwardness.)

I know it's not the typical path after graduating high school, but I'll keep everyone posted on how it's going. Thanks for all of the support :)

Message:My first post in Achieve With Mike. This is a blog (first attempt at one, actually) I've designed to share my thoughts throughout my final couple of years at NC State and whatever advice or lessons I can provide. I'll be hopefully writing for another blog as well as a part time job this coming Fall semester so I'll be partly using this as a portfolio.

For those wondering why the attempt at inspiration in the title, it's meant to go hand-in-hand with my goals of entering into career or life consulting after college.

Give it a read; it'll get interesting.

Story:N/A
Message:It is difficult to imagine the difference between girl and woman - because Gee, women aren't cookie cutter pieces of meat that fulfill a sexual or emotional desires that a man might have, but rather individuals with quirks, and aspirations, and large magnitude of personality. Who would have thought, right?! 

Woman/girl could be an interchangeable term for a woman, in my opinion, because the female in the situation is the one in charge of her identity.

Message:hAppy biRthDay, my love!! 

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? 
Thou art more lovely and more temperate: 
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, 
And summer's lease hath all too short a date: 
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, 
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd; 
And every fair from fair sometime declines, 
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd; 
But thy eternal summer shall not fade 
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest; 
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade, 
When in eternal lines to time thou growest: 
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, 
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

Also, Fallfest will be on the 17th this year. Who would be available to come and help out with the table/doing demonstrations? (I know we've all been practicing over the summer.... right?) Also, please post any ideas for cool demonstrations that can be done without a lot of setup or ways to incorporate the crowd if you have them.

Message:Listen up, folks. This is another one of those Ukyoung reviews food on campus not so eloquently.
THIS BAR. DIS BARRR. 
Okay so one, it's brownie crunch. So if you're craving that sweet snack in middle of the night but feel guilty about eating sweet stuff at this hour, this heavenly bar is here to save your sweet tooth. And true to its name, you can feel the crunchiness as you bite into the savory chocolate bar and feel victorious by imagining you're viciously crunching your stress and all the exams and papers you have between your teeth like a badass wolf.
 SO. IT HAS NO SUGAR. 0g SUGAR NEVER TASTED THIS GOOD. IT IS NOT LIKE OTHER BROWNIE BARS THAT YOU TAKE MORE THAN 4 BITES AND SWEETNESS COATING YOUR TONGUE FEELS LIKE TOO MUCH. This freaking no sugar bar gives you the satisfaction of sweetness but not to the point you're gagging. Just the right amount of sense of sugary delight without worrying sugar content. What more can you ask for?!?!
 I finished this badass bar in 5 minutes. And you know what I'm going to do tomorrow? Try out the other flavors like white chocolate and cookies and cream.
(so I wrote an essay lauding this bar. Why can't I write my proposal)

Love you guys and have an awesome summer.

Message:For Jacob & Levi. I love you guys so much and you are both my world. I am only here to guide you to make the right decisions for yourselves so you don't have to go through bad times that I did from making my own bad choices. Your decisions are yours and I trust that Jesus will ultimately be the director of your choices. Just know that what you decide now can affect your whole life. Consider asking Him first. For He, and ONLY He, is the one who will give you the VERY BEST direction when you stand at a fork in the road wondering which way to go. Listen to your heart <3, because that's where He lives. ALL MY LOVE ~ mom

Message:Poor Miata is lonely. I spent some time with her this morning before leaving for PT, but as I was walking down the steps I noticed this little paw under the door, then I saw her laying her face down inside the door so she could peak under the door. I went in and spent a few minutes more and have her some treats. Broke my heart.

Message:One thing we'll be discussing on Friday is which mascot we should use to represent our event. I think we should go ahead and start the discussion on mascots so it doesn't take up too much time during the meeting and those who might not be able to make it can still participate. Please feel free to give your opinion. All the mascot ideas should now be under the files. And keep in mind, these are all concept art, so if you think of a way to improve it, do tell, but keep it constructive. Remember, we're trying to keep this a salon, not a saloon.

Message:I have an idea for the mascot??the fox. I think a fox would be a good representation of what a hacker is. They are intelligent, majestic, mischevious, sly, and cunning beings. Though they?re weaker, they are always depicted as outsmarting the stronger creatures, such as wolves and bears, with their problem solving skills and tricks. I was thinking for this hackathon we could do a nine-tailed fox, also known as kitsune in Japan. According to eastern lore, they possess magical abilities and the more tails they have, the wiser and more powerful they are. 
http://www.mythicalcreaturesguide.com/page/Kitsune 

I think it really captures Fred Brooks?s definition of what a programmer is, particularly the last two sentences: 

?The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.... Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. [?] The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.?

If we combine this quote with a fox design, I think it would be a great marketing tool for HackNC specifically, since we?re wanting to make known and celebrate UNC as well as computer science. 

We can interpret the fox in so many ways as well. For example the many different tails can represent the various disciplines or departments or even the sponsors for the event. In addition we can adapt existing swag, i.e. fox mask, ears, videos, etc. allowing us to control costs and provide market tested paraphernalia that can be used over and over in promoting HackNC. I had already worked up a rough sketch depicting a nine-tailed fox that could be a nice graphic for a t-shirt and I?m presenting it here. The picture on the left is a color mockup. Please feel free to comment and give your opinion.

I got a chance to see the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Bund in Shanghai. It was all fogged (or smogged) up when I went, so pictures don't do them justice.

Scenic pictures dedicated to Maria and David ;)

Few shots taken by Chris, with a bunch of commentary for each picture.

yes? :)

the 1 mile is themed, so that's cool, but it's not very long at all, so in that case, the 5k is better. We could always do the 1 mile and then just keep running haha

Message:?Here's what I learned over the years. Know the mission, what is expected of you and your people. Get to know those people, their attitudes and expectations. Visit all the shops and sections. Ask questions. Don't be shy. Learn what each does, how the parts fit into the whole. Find out what supplies and equipment are lacking, what the workers need. To whom does each shop chief report? Does that officer really know the people under him, is he aware of their needs, their training? Does that NCO supervise or just make out reports without checking facts? Remember, those reports eventually come to you. Don't try to bullshit the troops, but make sure they know the buck stops with you, that you'll shoulder the blame when things go wrong. Correct without revenge or anger. Recognize accomplishment. Reward accordingly. Foster spirit through self-pride, not slogans, and never at the expense of another unit. It won't take long, but only your genuine interest and concern, plus follow-up on your promises, will earn you respect. Out of that you gain loyalty and obedience. Your outfit will be a standout. But for God's sake, don't ever try to be popular! That weakens your position, makes you vulnerable. Don't have favorites. That breeds resentment. Respect the talents of your people. Have the courage to delegate responsibility and give the authority to go with it. Again, make clear to your troops you are the one who'll take the heat.?

Message:I would like to give a huge thanks to Candace and Nicole, two angels that took care of me Thursday night. I was separated from my friends and put on the P2P. They saw how out of it I was and escorted, no, carried me home. Even came up to my friend's place to make sure I was going to be okay. I'm so grateful for both of them. I wish I knew more information about them! I hope they will hear of my appreciation for them both!

Despite the fact that she is a math and computer science double major, I have never seen her take out her stress on anyone, and I have never once heard her complain. There really is no one else like Hannah, and certainly no one else in the world who knows as much about One Direction, Little Mix, Five Seconds of Summer, The Office, and countless other TV shows and bands as she does. Hannah, you inspire me every day to be a more genuine human being. I love you so much, and I can't wait for the next two years together!

The advice she gives is exactly what I've ever needed to hear in my times of need. It kills me that after almost 3 years of knowing you, I am only now becoming better friends with you as you approach graduation. Please don't ever change. Your love and friendship is so genuine, it gives me hope in humanity. Thank you for being such an inspiration. You're so caring, incredibly smart, and extremely talented. I have no doubt that you will ever be anything less than extraordinary wherever life takes you. <3

You are by far one of the most genuine girls on this campus. Not only are you beautiful on the outside, but on the inside as well. You have an amazing ability to seek clarity and truth behind all circumstances. You're also an amazing listener...when someone needs advice, you go above and beyond to make sure that you given them the truth. Words will never be able to articulate just how much your worth. But...your worth a lot to me. Everyday I see you, I'm reminded of why I'm grateful to have you in my life. I strive to be more like you. You mean so much to so many people beautiful lady.

Message:Cosette is settling in and her personality is really starting to shine. She is still on very strong antibiotics 3 times a day and while the swelling has gone down some in her left front leg we are still battling the infection. Sadly with now being in foster care and getting more activity the leg has really started bothering her. We will finish the antibiotics and then re-evaluate the leg and come up with a game plan. Thank you all for ordering from our Scentsy Fundraiser. It is very appreciated and Cosette sends lots of kisses to each of you

Message:Every morning I wake up 
I wake up to know that, 
I'm a day closer to the day I die.
 
Every time I go to sleep
I pray that I wake tomorrow so,
that I can once again wake to know that,
I'm 1 day closer to the day I die.

If I die in between my wake and sleep, 
that means all that I needed to do,
has been done, so I no longer need,
to sleep or wake for my time is up and done.
