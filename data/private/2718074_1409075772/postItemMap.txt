Message:As per our talk today: "It is always my wish that you might find enough patience within yourself to endure, and enough innocence to have faith. It is my wish that you might gain more and more trust in whatever is difficult for you?. Allow life to happen to you. Believe me, life is right in all cases.?Your doubt can become a good attribute if you discipline it. It must become a knowing; it must become the critic. Ask it, as often as it wishes to spoil something, why something is ugly. Demand proof of it, test it, and you will find it perhaps perplexed and confused, perhaps also in protest. Don?t give in; demand arguments. Act with alertness and responsibility, each and every time, and the day will come when doubt will change from the destroyer to become one of your best fellow-workers, perhaps the wisest of all that have a part in building your life. You ask whether your poems are good. You send them to publishers; you compare them with other poems; you are disturbed when certain publishers reject your attempts. Well now, since you have given me permission to advise you, I suggest that you give all that up. You?re looking outward and, above all else, that you must not do now. No one can advise and help you, no one. There is only one way: Go within?." --Rilke

Message:Hey there, Carolyn ... my name is George Raboni and you and I performed in a series of one act plays at a space on W. 43rd St. a few years ago.  Anyway, I hope this finds you well!  The reason for this note ... a good friend of mine, Rome Neal is the artistic director at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe on  E. 3rd St.  I did two shows there a few years ago and it was one of my favorite theatrical experiences ever.  Great space!  Rome is looking for a 30-40 yr old woman for a wonderful piece.  You may be too young but if you know anyone, either have them google Rome or reach out to him on FB.  Best of luck with all your theatrical opportunities.

So when we got into the car, Mia said she changed her mind and wants to be a doctor when she grows up! I let go a big sigh of relief because I was not sure how to train her to become Elsa from Frozen as that was her previous answer when adults asked her that question.

Message:So I run into Walmart this morning because I need chocolate and vanilla sandwich cookies for my classes to model moon phases. Yes, I looked like a mad pregnant woman at 6 in the morning with five packs of cookies. When I got to the cashier she said, "Whoa! You must be having some craving!" I laughed and explained it to her, but I couldn't help to think what if I did get a crazy craving like this? Who will I blame it on when I look like the crazy pregnant lady? :)

Every night this guy washes 350 towels, brings soap, shampoo, clean boxers and socks, and of course, water for showering to soldiers on the front lines, some of whom haven't seen their homes in over 20 days and haven't had a shower in that span of time.

Message:I am sorry that I cannot do more to help the ?matzav? (situation) in Israel.  The truth is I feel so incredibly helpless sitting here safe in the US while the people of Israel (My People) are living their lives in fear.  Fear that they may not make it to the bomb shelters in time, fear that they will get a message that is was their brother, their sister, their father, their friend who lost his or her life in Gaza, fear of not knowing when this will end. 

I am sorry I am not there in Israel right now with my friends and family.  I am sorry for the loss of lives (on both sides).  I am sorry that we cannot be left to live in peace.  

I am NOT sorry that I keep posting so many articles (I?m sure some of you have blocked me from your walls by now).  Though there is little I can do, it is my hope that my constant stream of articles may help to educate those who do not fully understand the situation and who are being swayed by the incredibly one-sided portrayal of Israel in international media.  If I can open at least one person?s eyes to the reality of the situation, that Israel wants to save lives, and Hamas wants to take them, then I?ve done something.  

I am NOT sorry that Israel is standing and defending herself. 

I WILL ALWAYS STAND WITH ISRAEL.

Message:Fearless Friday Time.
Nearly ten years ago, I walked into 440 Lafayette Street having no idea what to expect from my impending undergraduate theatre training, and my life was literally transformed, literally, over the course of four years.  It was challenging, frustrating, enlightening, riveting, and I forged forever friendships (Mary-Catherine Moore, Taylor Tobin, Lilly DeForest, Mary Amelia Beyer, Ruby Joy) along with a career that has been entirely and only my own since graduating.  I continuously find myself referring back to my training at Playwrights Horizons Theater School, only because the saturation of knowledge, artistry, and diligence was so well integrated into my professional habits.
I am a proud alumna of this school, which will celebrate its 30th Anniversary this Monday.
Happy Fearless Friday.

Message:Hi Sarah Glendon! I know that you are a pet lover like me!  I am asking some of the people I know who love animals and are local - MD, VA, and the surrounding areas - to help me help a very special rescue group.  I have been following Lab Rescue LRCP for more than a year and this year have decided to get involved.  Lab Rescue is a local, non-profit, volunteer driven organization committed to rescuing and finding loving new homes for abandoned and abused Labrador Retrievers. Last year Lab Rescue helped 1005 labs!!  That's one thousand and five labs!  Each lab brought into Lab Rescue is vetted ? brought up-to-date on their shots, tested for Heartworm and Lyme disease, and spayed/neutered if not already.   Some dogs require more extensive veterinary care, such as treatment for broken bones, removing cancerous lumps and treating parasitic conditions.  The cost to care for Lab Rescue dogs continues to rise and constitutes 97% of the rescue's expenses. You can learn more about Lab Rescue LRCP here:  http://www.imis100us1.com/labs/                   
Or here:  https://www.facebook.com/LabRescueLRCP

I have committed to raise $500 for the walk and have donated a pet photography session fee worth $250 for the silent auction prizes.  Can you help with a donation?  Here is the website where you can do so securely:  https://dogwalk.dojiggy.com/ng/index.cfm/ac29174/reg-pages/pledge/LITTLEPINKTOESPETPHOTOGRAPHYANGELAMOORE

Thanks in advance Sarah!  (((((hugs)))))

Read this article!
Leisa Glotfelty, Julie Nixon, Valerie Baker, Rhonda Riley, Ned , Kymmie Brownell, Rameen Hashemiyoon, Ben Kaplan-Singer, Elizabeth, Susan Aussicker, 

Could physicians come together to overthrow the current order ? to start a movement to, say, Occupy Medicine? If they did, what would be the unifying cry? Down with health insurers? Tort reform or bust? Or would it begin by expressing the thing that is most precious to them that has been lost: the opportunity to practice medicine in a way that is worthy of their dedication and love. Reclaiming a sense of meaning in medicine could be the first step to rescuing the profession.

I just went online to pay my latest balance and found that my number had been stolen and over $2,500 in charges were made over the last 2 days in 3 different states. Don't know how/when/where my number was swiped but I still have the card itself so obviously they don't need the plastic. They were able to use my number both online and in person.

Message:For those of you not aware, we got a significant snow storm in Atlanta today. I left work at 4:15pm and did not get home until 8:55pm ... I live 4 miles from the office. After 3 hours in traffic (where I went a total of 2 miles) my car got stuck in a valley of a local neighborhood and I was forced to abandon my car and walk home the rest of the way in the snow (wearing my new dress shoes). I could not in my wildest imagination have thought that a city the size of Atlanta, a city crippled by a similar storm 3 years ago, would be so unprepared for 3 inches of snow. Some of my employees have been on the road for over 8 hours and still haven't made it home. I'll have to wait a couple of days for the city to thaw before finding how out much damage my car will take sitting in a poorly lit area with people spinning out of control left and right. Unreal.

Atlanta friends, did everyone get home ok today?

Message:Monday night's win made me reflect on how far the DC Panthers Fans has come as a group. It was the day after watching Super Bowl XXXVIII with other #Panthers fans at the State Theater in Falls Church that I did maybe 10 minutes of intense internet research but could not find a single Panthers group or bar. There were bars and meet-ups for some of the crappiest teams  but none for the Panthers. After taking to the Craigslist (before it was mostly for casual sex) and MeetUp we managed to get a few folks involved. For the first few years Amy, Rick McKnight, his friend and I made up "the group". We were relegated to the basement of Rhodeside Grill's wall of CRT TVs. Since then we have moved to other places long gone but the group has grown considerably. Mark Sussman helped grow the group while we moved to Charlotte. Since we moved to McFadden's DC things have really taken off. The staff and management at McFadden's have helped the group grow. They have stuck by us during the good times and the bad. They have gone the extra mile to make their bar feel like home. The seasons have been lean (The Pickle Period) but now it feels like the group has taken on a life of it's own that is very active, lively, passionate and engaged. The donations of Panthers swag and "Tiny" by Jayme Thysell, our often-photographed "Bubba" by Shandi Stracke Treloar really help make the day. Mike McDonald coordinates the trivia and is fully responsible for the Greg Hardy-themed Kraken shots. Jayme and Jamison Doran also help keep the Twitter feed updated (which is @dcpanthersfans, FYI).

Over the last year(ish) alone Jesshond Johnson worked with Samaritan's Feet and Steve Smith to organize a volunteer event when the Panthers were in town. The bus trip to the Landover whooping (during their "homecoming") was a huge success (there will be another!). And now we are packing the place weekly with over 100 Panthers fans (that's what happens when we're winning!)

Thank you everyone for growing the group and make it a success. #KeepPounding!

Message:"Because here's something else that's weird but true: in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshiping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship--be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles--is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It's the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It's been codified as myths, proverbs, clich?s, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness."

Message:I really really wish Facebook wasn't such a useful tool at times. More than anything it just seems like a vehicle for extreme vanity and narcissism. For every funny or enlightening post I find there's 10 more obvious attempts to have praise heaped upon you for how you look, what you ate, or what you can afford.

And the worst part is a few of the people that read this will be all AMEN BROTHER when they're exactly the problem.

I realize many of those posts are intended to share things with close friends (even though everyone sees it), but damn...some people could really stand to catch a whiff of humility.

Story:N/A
Message:This is absolutely disgusting. She lies about what the morning after pill does and proceeds to scare the shit out of who she thinks is a vulnerable teen. She is not a doctor, a  nurse, or a medical professional! Having an abortion or carrying your pregnancy to term should be decided by a woman and her doctor... with the FACTS laid out. Yes, if you are sexually active you should be responsible and protect yourself from unwanted pregnancies and STDs/STIs, BUT sh*t happens sometimes and women should be informed before making life-changing decisions, not coerced/manipulated/lied to by some religious nut whose mission is to coerce/manipulate/lie to vulnerable women in order to prevent an abortion...

Message:Unbelievable.

Am currently on the phone AGAIN with BCBSNC (after two hours spent on the phone yesterday). Was told my request has been initially denied and sent to the medical director for review. The reason it had been denied: they found in their database of in-network providers a specialist within a 5 mile radius of me. That would have been perfect, except that I notified BCBSNC 1 MONTH AGO that this particular specialist had changed practices and was now with the practice I am trying to get into. When this doctor changed practices, that meant there were no longer ANY specialists of this kind practicing in a 100 mile radius of Raleigh that would take my plan. Because (up until yesterday) I had to speak with a different person each time I called, this information never got passed on to the appropriate people. Thankfully, the young man who has been helping me since yesterday has now personally taken on my case and is reaching out to the appropriate people with this new information. And yet, I am still without an appointment to see a medically necessary specialist for a condition I've been dealing with for 8 months now.

Message:Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina woes update:

One week and another hour-and-25-minute phone call later, and it appears some progress is being made in my quest to have my specialist visit be approved at the in-network rate. After numerous phone calls where I was shuttled from department to department and speaking with people who would rather repeat their same three sentences rather than actually listen to my issue, I was put through to a representative who listened to my problem and agreed with me that it was ridiculous that I couldn't find a specialist in network within a 100 mile radius. When I explained to her that the in network fee was $10, compared to the out-of-network fee of $380 (minimum) I was going to be charged if the paperwork didn't go through, she actually related to my problem, and stayed with me on the line until my paperwork was flagged for immediate review by a nurse. (When we started talking an hour and a half previously, the nurse review department was telling her they didn't have the paperwork. They did.) The fact that it took over a month before I finally spoke with someone who was willing to do their job and take the time to help me with my issue is appalling. But I can't thank her enough -- without her I'd still be in the land of "paperwork not received."

I'll be subletting a room near the Fort Totten metro station for three months, from where I will be doing my job search full-time. If anyone has any information on human rights/nonprofit jobs in the DC area, please send it my way! I'm looking to make connections and make this career thing happen!

Message:Important crowdsource question: what time is the actual kickoff for today's World Cup Final (Eastern Daylight time, please)? I'm not talking "when coverage begins" bullcrap, I'm talking when the match itself starts. Internet sources are telling me one time, but that time is contrary to every other kickoff time of the entire tournament thus far. Thoughts? I'd greatly appreciate it if you can support your assertions with evidence.

Message:Dear Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina,

You cannot expect me to put my life on hold for telephone calls that last over an hour each time (90% of which consists of me being on hold) at least once a week so that I can make sure you are doing your job. When it is deemed medically necessary by my primary care provider that I need to see a specialist, and you choose not to have such a specialist within a 100 mile radius of Raleigh, North Carolina (a state capitol, no less) that will take a plan THAT YOU SELL TO NORTH CAROLINIANS, it is not only preposterous, it is illegal for you to continue to stall in approving my "application" to see said specialist. At current count, I have been on the phone (just today) for 1 hr 20 min, have had my call dropped twice, and have been told my paperwork, which was faxed over by my primary care provider TWO WEEKS AGO, was never received. If this is not resolved today, expect a letter to the editor in the N&O in your near future.

I am not moving from the state of North Carolina *today*. I am helping my parents move to their new townhouse in Raleigh. Which, given that they have an actual household (as opposed to my scattered belongings), is what gave me the impending sense of doom. I will be heading to DC at the beginning of August for a three month trial period while I continue my job search: if you have any leads on sublets, send them my way :)

"One public advocate for Feiglin's vision is American-born Rabbi Ben Packer, once a campus cleric for Duke University and the University of North Carolina and now the director of a center for young Jewish visitors to Israel and a fan of extending the Israeli border into Palestine (sic). He wrote earlier this month, "Of course, we should continue to hunt all of those responsible for the rocket fire and make every effort to eliminate them -- but that's not good enough! We need a tangible victory and moving the border of the northern Gaza Strip provides us with that."

Message:"It?s inspiring to know the second largest pork producer in the United States is listening to consumer voices and encouraging suppliers to make some massive changes to end these types of abuses.

Tyson is making recommendations to:
?	Improve housing systems by allowing sows of all sizes to stand, turn around, lie down, and stretch their legs;
?	Discontinue the practice of slamming piglets headfirst against the ground to kill them;
?	Manage pain during tail docking and castration of piglets;
?	Install video monitoring systems on farms to improve animal handling and increase oversight and worker accountability
We know that informed consumers will continue to inspire companies to take additional steps to reduce animals? suffering, and we?ll monitor their progress so the public is aware. Thank you in advance for your continued support of animal protection causes in 2014.
Thanks for the support,
Mercy For Animals"

Well...at least they are "making recommendations" to stop slamming piglets against the ground. Ridiculous.

In honor of the #icebucketchallenge :1-ALS, in honor of my family: 2-American Diabetes Assoc, 3-Alzheimer's Assoc, 4-Colon Cancer Coalition, and in honor of move-in day today at Penn, 5: Penn Hillel!

Challenging: Laura Antoinette DiPasquale, Kayla Davis, Sarah Lambert, Andrea Dawn Rose, and MacKenzie Lovell. Bucket/donate it up! 

Also, check out this article about NIH funding and the huge impact Congress has on funding for ALS and these other important health organizations doing biomedical research--contacting your representatives can make a HUGE difference!

Message:We are finally in Hawaii! Our two connections one day flying turned into all day at airport (8hr delay after waking at 3:30am to get to airport at 5am) reroute to CLT nc (running to make connection almost missed it) then to LAX airport then shuttle to overnight hotel...5 hrs of sleep with Zachary's foot in my face...woke up 4am back to airport security again 2hr delay and then 5 1/2 hr flight to hawaii! 

Craziness seems to follow us but I have the most AMAZING boys and hubby!!!

Both boys took all the punches and long waits and flights as a adventure! No meltdowns and Oli only cried once for milk before boarding  the plane!! Zachary's first meltdown complaining was when we were picking up our rental car bc he couldn't ride the city bus again ;( haha

Message:When telling Zachary about our move to Hawaii in about a week, and showing him pictures of Hawaii beaches and airplanes, his only two questions are:
Can I swim at the beach? 
Can I roll my (airplane) window down? 
I guess if those are his only concerns we will do alright.

Message:I just read this and thought of our conversation ? I think it's a nice little supplement and food for thought:

"The notion of universal suffrage raises at once the question of the economic conditions prerequisite to the perfection of political democracy. Can men exercise the political freedom of citizenship without freedom from economic dependence of the will of other men? It was commonly thought by 18th century republicans that they could not. 'A power over a man?s subsistence,' [Alexander] Hamilton declares, ?amounts to a power over his will.' On the basis it was urged by many during the Philadelphia convention that a property qualification was necessary for suffrage.

Kant also argues that suffrage 'presupposes the independence or self-sufficiency of the individual citizen.' Because apprentices, servants, minors, women, and the like do not maintain themselves, each 'according to his own industry, but as it is arranged by others,' he claims that they are 'mere subsidiaries of the Commonwealth and not active independent members of it,' being 'of necessity commanded and protected by others.' For this reason, he concludes they are 'passive,' not 'active,? citizens and can be rightfully deprived of the franchise.

? In the opinion of Karl Marx, the 'battle for democracy' will not be won, nor even the 'first steps' taken towards it, until 'the working class raises the proletariat to the position of ruling class.' Quite apart from the merits of the revolutionary political philosophy which Marx erects, his views, and those of other social reformers of the 19th century, have made it a central issue that democracy be conceived in social and economy terms as well as political. Otherwise, they insist, what is called 'democracy' will permit, and may even try to condone, social inequalities and economic injustices which vitiate political liberty."

Unfortunately i cannot go tomorrow - too much work.  But any time next week post-tuesday works.  Who knows, we might even be able to do something social next week as well!?

Even more noteworthy: really sobering evidence that underscores the implicit bias in our schools to overly assign black boys to special education and - in so doing - farm them out of opportunities and into pipelines of inequity and flagrant injustice.

Message:Confidence = a solution to the gender gap? A fascinating, compelling read. Fittingly, I was listening to the confident Xtina, Lil' Kim, Mya, and P!nk belt "Lady Marmalade" as I read. My mind kept thinking about how we are seeing this confidence spread more and more here in the States - across education (Wendy Kopp, Kya Henderson, Michelle Rhee), across politics (Wendy Davis, Tammy Baldwin, Elizabeth Warren, Sonia Sotomayor), even across the small screen (Alicia Florrick, Carrie Matheson, Claire Underwood). And yet: so much more energy, attention, support, and - yes - confidence need to be instilled in our efforts to achieve gender equity. #closethegap #heysistagosista

Message:So I'm sitting on the couch with Lindsay Guge Cozon, talking about life and admitted that I don't really know what Mother Teresa actually did. After being scolded for my ignorance, I asked Lindsay what an ion was, in two words. To her credit, she said "charged particle" and then followed up with "I know about protons, electrons and neurons!" It takes all kinds....

Message:I have to say that I'm genuinely impressed by Apple's customer service. I brought my four year old laptop into the Apple store because it wasn't charging. While I was 99% sure the problem was with the power adapter, I wanted to make sure the battery was OK.

It turns out that the problem WAS with my adapter. Even though my computer was no longer under warranty, there was apparently a recall on the adapters sold with that generation of Macbook Pros -- so I got a brand new adapter for free. 

Four years later.

Thanks Apple you made my day! :)

Message:My seniors are reading 1984. When discussing propaganda / the power of the media, one of my students said we have more gun control now because of all the news stories about Sandy Hook. I had to stop seminar to tell her, no, that's actually the opposite of what really happened. One of those momenta where you realize that those who aren't made to pay close attention end up blindly trusting the government to do the right thing.

Name:Senate budget ties teacher raises to dropping tenure rights :: WRAL.com
Story:N/A
Message:First the state of North Carolina says teachers have a "right to work" so we can't have a union. Now when the still-in-existence union (I mean "association" - no, I mean union) makes a real fuss about five years of stagnant pay, they say we can have our raises if we give up the few tenure protections we have left. Anyone see the pattern? Anyone need a teacher to show them how to infer cause and effect? Maybe analyze character motivations? Bet my kids could explain to everyone what's really going on.

Message:Mimi, I?m not sure I even know where to start. I?ve been kicking this around in my head for days, wondering just what I would say? 

I guess I?ll start at the beginning. I?ve been calling you Mimi since I could form words.  That?s because you?ve been around since long before I could even think about forming words.  

For just about every conceivable life event of any significance that I?ve had in my 26 years and change on this earth, you?ve been there.  You and Pop-pop have been there for all of us, through every single step. I can?t even begin to thank you enough for everything you have meant to Matt and Mark and I (and the little ones, too!). 

You are the singular example of how to live a life in the purest of ways, for every member of our family.  Heck, you?re that example for an entire congregation of people at Jonesville.  If they have a supersonic bullet-train to Heaven, you?ll be on it. 

I think back to your retirement party a couple years ago, and Linda?s poem about you. And I think about the few short words I said before I read her poem.  We are an esteemed few, who get to call you Mimi (or Mom!).  It is a privilege unlike any other, to be your grandchild. To have you in our lives? it?s unfathomable how lucky we all are.  You are an amazing mother, a truly epic grandmother, and the best person we all know.

One thing I will forever think of, though, whenever I think of you, is music.  That?s been the case my whole life, and that will continue.  Your ability to teach a room full of people ? be they preschoolers, pre-teens, or pre-retirees ? is unmatched.  And it?s breathtaking.

I just think back to my time at Jonesville ? heck, probably 15-16 years worth of time that I was actually cognizant of the world ? and I just remember you between the aisles. Between the aisles, with your right hand in the air, chopping away keeping time as we all played bells. 

Or you in front of the choir loft, belting out every hymn along with your choir, every single eye trained on you, as you commanded the group. 

Or you leading the Christmas Cantata?s when Shen UMC and Jonesville would team up? even when I was in grade school, I remember watching those Cantatas, and being mesmerized by how powerful the music was.  And that was you. At your finest. In your utmost glory. Just doing what you did, every single day.

And to think, I?ve said all that and still not even touched on your days teaching piano to Matt and I, and the Rome brothers, and so many dozens of others. 

(By the way, I?ve already asked for a keyboard for my birthday, so I can get back into it? I want to relearn how to play, and keep your legacy going. I have the big hands & long fingers for it, right?!? ?)

Mimi, I love you more than I think I could ever put into words, even if this post went on for another 500.  You are the best person I know, and the example by which every single one of us should live our lives. 

Please know that all the love and support you?ve received in the past few weeks (and the past few years, for that matter), is only just a fragment of what we all feel for you.  That?s just the tee shot on the first hole. There?s still an approach, a putt, and 17 more holes worth of support and love and prayers behind what you?ve seen, from hundreds more people you?ve affected in your life.

You are an institution. Every one of us knows it. 

I love you, Mimi. I will be home very, very soon.

Name:2 out of every 3 Americans lost Fourth Amendment protections to DHS
Story:N/A
Message:If this article is accurate (suspension of 4th Amendment over massive areas of the U.S. including most population centers), I would not consider the current US authority system to be a legitimate United States federal government as defined under the US Constitution.

Ironically, I'm almost hesitant to post this, because (as we know from other reporting), it will be archived and subject to government access for an indefinite amount of time.

Which means that legally and technologically, DHS can now (and, in the future) hunt me down and severely persecute me. (I'm not going to claim they can acutally kill me, though _maybe_ they can, since apparently Obama has authority to kill anyone deemed a "terrorist." Am I a terrorist if I "fearmonger" about the US internal security system? I'm not actually sure about the scope of Obama's claims, though.)

The only thing stopping them is simply that they haven't decided to do it (yet). Fortunately. People who say, "Stop worring, they're not actually going to hurt you, they're just trying to do their job more efficiently" are probably right, for now. But it still should not just be "up to them," "if" they decide to do their job properly.

An internal national-level police system with unlimited power to observe everything and persecute anyone without any legal restraints is precisely the definition of the intelligence services used in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.

And the scary thing is, the situation here in America was not created by accident; it was created by intent. (Though I'm not alleging an organized conspiracy, except in the sense that the DHS is itself organized.)

My heart is so full of love and gratitude toward everyone who volunteered, donated, attended, worked for, celebrated and sent love and support from afar to make the premiere of 3000 Miles to a Cure's film HOPE an incredible success. Just a few of those people are Maria Parker, Jenny Paparella Mulligan, Timothy Mulligan, Charlie Mulligan, Carly Redfearn, Nathan Aaron Dowdy, Cait Butt (and the whole Butt family), Courtney Slough, Amy Foster, The Killettes (I'm tagging you, Spencer Killette) and the Vickstroms (and you, Christina Vickstrom). Again, just a few of the many. Thank you all for coming together with us to redefine impossible.

Story:N/A
Message:To have my own experience explained with such accuracy in someone else's words is a mind trip. A tip of the hat to Willy Tex for this amazing write up of one of my most powerful experiences as part of the LostinSound team. Huge love to the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors and their entire staff for making everything possible and to all the artists: Random Rab, Kalya Scintilla, Govinda Music, Supersillyus, Andy Reed, and Joness Jones for participating in our interviews and documentation of the Vernal Equinox event.  

The documentary is still in the workings, Daria Mehra and I are working hard to properly represent the majestic environment and vibe that is cultivated at CoSM and try to tap into how exactly this environment is created, and all the meaningful functional benefits it brings about. Once this is finished we will also be releasing full footage of the individual interviews which covered many topics outside the scope of our documentary. 

Until we finish the videos, quench your thirst for knowledge and wisdom with this well written article about the event and in general the experience one might have at CoSM:

Please share and spread the good word! <3

Message:This is my first and probably only post about the conflict, but I was feeling great this morning until I started thinking about everybody in Gaza and Israel. I don't know all of the details but it seems like the Palestinians need to get Hamas out of the picture from within. Israel is clearly threatened by Hamas and there will be no peace with the threat of tunnels, rockets and jihad. It's almost like Gaza has been hijacked by Hamas and international hate for Israel! I hate to see so many dead civilians, and I don't think it's helping diplomacy, but I do think Hamas needs to be pacified and give up their philosophy calling for the destruction of Israel. Sadness and frustration.

Reefer Madness: The Musical 

Possibly the best movie adaptation of a musical ever.  Showtime spent a buttload of money, including securing a stellar cast, with Alan Cumming, Kristen Bell, Ana Gasteyer, Steven Weber and Neve Campbell.  

Saw a production of the stage show at UNC with Paul Nguyen, Kelsey Reinhard, and Katie Keenan!

This might be one of the longest sequences in the show, but it's very spooky...  This whole show is sidesplittingly funny, but has quite a few intense horror sequences!

So when he asked me what I studied in school, I said, "Taxidermy." ("It's part of the Nicholas School of Environmental Studies at Duke." "I got interested in it when my parents showed me this BEAUTIFUL stuffed hawk that my great grandfather shot and stuffed.")

What then ensued was a ten-minute conversation about his love of ornithology.

Message:Happy Happy Birthday to my wonderful sister, Kaila Ramsey! I hope you have such a very special day today. I'm incredibly proud of you, the beautiful person that you are, and of all of your accomplishments. I know that their will be many more successes to come for you in the upcoming year! I am so thrilled that Matthew Garza and you have found each other AND that you have added a new member to your family, Zoe Hot Pants, a super cute dog.

Love you bunches, sis!

Also...I found this :) Sounds about right to me. (We June 13thers have to stick together). :) 

Birthday Persona Profile 
People born specifically on the 13th of June are predicted to be creative, logical and adventurous with lots of the typical Gemini communicative wit. The ruling astrological planet for this particular day is Uranus making you a little individualistic yet charming with a strong willfulness and a sense of fun. If you have this birthday your active mind is intellectual and often way ahead of its time but you are easily frustrated by inaction or boredom. You are especially good at adapting to change as you understand it is often necessary for growth and usually prepare and plan for everything. Your realistic outlook and sense of purpose direct you to not ordinarily let emotion cloud any of your judgments. Individuals with a June the thirteenth birthday tend to possess their own unique style, moral code and view of the world. Clever and versatile you are a hard worker who is responsible, practical and ambitious with a passion for unusual and interesting things and places.

Of course, he *was* pouring himself a beer when I turned my back on him ten minutes after bar close, and then physically trying to wrestle it out of my hand as I took it from him, so I didn't take it too hard. Even if you're pretty and charming and have a british accent... it's pretty low to be a dick to your bartender.

Story:N/A
Message:If you have not yet seen South Korean K-pop sensation Psy, then you must see this. The video is "Gangnam Style". Apparently, Gangnam is a fashionable district in Seoul, South Korea. Think Beverley Hills, but with lots of Asians. The video has garnered over 300 million views. The sensation has crossed cultural boundaries. Someone said to me recently, "this is gangnam style bitches". Just wanted to keep you informed of cultural references in case you run into them in your daily life.

Name:Corporate Profits Are Eating the Economy
Story:N/A
Message:"When the economy crashes, we all crash together: corporate profits, employment, and growth. But when the economy recovers, we don't recover together. Corporations rack up historic profits thanks to strong global demand, cheap global labor, and low interest rates, while American workers muddle along, their significance to these companies greatly diminished by a worldwide market for goods and people."

I'm no economist, so I'm far from being someone who can make an educated assessment about corporate finances.  But if cheap globalized labor is one of the biggest impediments to improving the average income and employment rates for our lower and middle classes, then we need to change gears and roll with the times. We should be dumping bigger investments toward provision of quality, affordable education for adults, regardless of age, so that they have no problems advancing their career or increasing their intellectual contribution to society.

They have been able to raise money to help all of the students going, but now are trying to do something pretty special. They are trying to surprise one of my babies with a FULLY FUNDED TRIP! His story is rough but he is the brightest and sweetest student I have ever taught. His mom is supportive of their effort but he has NO IDEA!

If you donate by TOMORROW your funds will be matched with the code INSPIRE.

http://www.donorschoose.org/mrsnovotny/?active=true&rf=page_siteshare_2014_03_teacherid_679470 is the link. 

Also- select "no" to the optional 15% and it will take even less time for us to get this funded!!

His guidance has allowed these kids to see their potential as excellent musicians and more importantly, as good people. It has always my dream to see this band grow to such a size and such a mature sound. I love this band program because of the love we share for music and each other. Just know that a piece of YOU will always be with US. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan. I can't wait to see where life takes you. Much love from your band kids; past and present.

Message:Dear friends, 

My new profile picture signals an exciting new chapter. However, as I write this, my heart is a bit heavy; as a moment like this is quintessentially bittersweet.

As many of you know, since I was a young child I have wanted to learn and teach music and I have wanted to fly. I have been very fortunate to have had the opportunity to pursue both passions simultaneously in varying degrees over the past several years.

After a year of very careful consideration, made more difficult by the wonderful experiences I have had in these past three years as Band Director at Garner High School, I will be putting down the conducting baton this June in pursuit of a career as a commercial pilot. 

Teaching the students at Garner has been one of the great privileges of my life. I am in awe of my students' dedication to reaching for the best in themselves and others beyond the band room, thus improving their craft within the band room in unbelievable ways. 

Over the past three years, our band students have embraced a culture all their own and have so fully developed their character, leadership skills, and musicianship in the process.

This summer and into next fall, I will continue my aviation training at a flight school back in Colorado on a full time schedule. Although it will be a difficult departure for me, the timing could not be better, not only in terms of my personal goals; but also in terms of the GMHS Band Program, which I feel is healthier than ever, as a result of the uncompromising dedication, persistence, and leadership of students and parents alike. I am confident that the band's best days are ahead as long as the students heed the call and embrace the opportunities with which they are tasked. 

As I told the students today, "If I could have a superpower it would be the ability to be in two places at once" but until someone figures out how to do that, tough decisions need to be made. For all of us, may we remember that life only happens once (as far as we know, since no one has been back to tell us otherwise) and may we summon the courage to get out of our own way and live this life in a manner that allows us to fulfill the most colorful of our dreams here and now. 

To a great spring and a powerful end to the school year!

Thank you for being who you are, doing what you do, and motivating me without even knowing it.  Anybody can be a teacher, but it takes a unique individual to be the kind of teacher that you all are. Happy Teacher Appreciation Week!

Hello Yiddshe Maidelach!
So heres the deal... Tznius is an incredably important mitzvah. As we will soon learn, tznius is representative of our yiras shamayim, its how we imbue our homes with kidusha and its how we present ourselves to others. Tznius includes both our outward appearance as well as an inner refinement, eidelkite.
How it works... I am going to pre-program.......

We took the Vamoose bus early in the morning, met Marci in NYC where we all shopped and visited the amazing Frick Collection and then hopped back on the bus to return to MD.  If you've not seen the Frick Collection, it's well worth the visit. The Frick family built this house in 1914. After his wife died, Henry Clay Frick had noted in his will that he wanted to bequeath the house and the art collections for the public to enjoy.   Here's the website for more info: http://www.frick.org.

Message:When did, in this country, did we start to assign guilt before knowing all the facts? We have the town of Ferguson ready to charge a man of murder when the only "facts" they know are eye witness accounts, which are notoriously unreliable and counter even the families autopsy, and an autopsy, which was paid for by the family of the person who is dead. We haven't heard #darrenwilson side of the story, seen any forensic evidence, or an autopsy by an independent third party. But yet people are rioting in the street, shooting at cops, and tearing a town apart. People scream they want justice. You want justice? Go home tonight. When it gets dark, go home. Let the police pick out the bad apples and restore order to the people who want to peacefully protest. Come back in the morning and exercise your First Amendment rights in peace. Otherwise you destroy what too many people who have worked so hard for over many, many years.

As a side note, to the people who think that Michael Brown is an innocent party who can do no wrong, the tape at the store may not of been known to the officer, but it proves history and motive. 

Justice through peace and a proper investigation, not through violence. That's how we move forward.

When you go into the bank to ask for a loan, you shouldn't walk in with a tank top, ripped jeans, spitting a huge wad of dip in a Gatorade bottle as you walk over to the loan manager.

Use that treason to possibly get your buddies and fellow servicemen and servicewomen hurt or killed. Sure, you didn't pull the trigger but your info can cause other to. Then, make your trial public. Then, after being sentenced to a very light sentence of 35 years, request your sex change treatment all while on the taxpayer dime from a civilian prison.

What's wrong with this picture? Plastic surgery for traitors? On mine and your dime?

Story:N/A
Message:So you don't turn over evidence to the district attorney, and he has to publicly request it, of which turning over evidence to him for prosecution is required by law. Then you use a serious incident in which laws were broken to try to salvage your campaign and take heat off yourself. Then you publicly comment on a on going investigation, compromising it. Then you get caught lying by the daily news, who is apparently oblivious of it. They stated in one article that the suspects mother didn't know what was going on and she couldn't get her child out of jail. Then they quoted in another that Brown states that his mother knew what he was doing and shamed him for it. Then to go as far as accusing Millers campaign of trying to ASSASSINATE THE SITTING SHERIFF and then just let it go. Like that is a small thing. Ridiculous. If you needed another reason to vote for Miller, here it is. Shame on you Ed Brown for jeopardizing the citizens of this county for your own personal gain.

I really can't believe it...two years ago I never would have imagined I'd be earning a master's degree in accounting and preparing to start an exciting new career.  This year in the MAC program has been the most transformative, wonderful, intensely stressful year of my life and the most difficult thing I've ever done.  I have never been more confident that with lots of hard work and dedication, anything is possible.  Hugs to the amazing MAC students, who have wowed me every day since last May, and who have been an incredibly kind and supportive community the whole way through.  I'm so excited to get to share commencement next week with such bright people.  WE DID IT!!

Story:N/A
Message:I am certain that many of you remember my prayer request from late July-early August 2011 regarding my nephew Ryan Haymaker who fell 1200 feet down a snowy and rocky mountain in the Grand Tetons and was critically injured, spending three weeks in a coma, months in the hospital and rehab, and more than a year in recovery. He graduated with a Bachelor's degree from Texas Tech this past May and is currently making a solo excursion up the East Coast, visiting friends, family, and places along the way. James Thomas Ayres, Seth Ayres, and I were blessed to be able to host Ryan these past three days. Even Sean Ayres was able to stop by after work last night and eat dinner with us. It was such a pleasure to have him here, and to see how well he is doing! He left this morning, and we already miss him. If you want to read about his adventures and follow along on his blog, here is the link: http://mytravelseast.blogspot.com/

I don't believe I look any more "legit" by hiding in the van or staring stone-faced from the back of the venue. I don't care. Life is too short to not share in the moment with all the artists on the bill.

Message:In the midst of a profoundly stressful time, what with unresolved questions about employment and housing, this has been an exceptionally fantastic two weeks. Thanks to Mike Helferstay for arranging lodging in Greenpoint and looking after us; to Vanessa Van Landingham for being our cruise director and making for many great times; to Trevor Safford for making time to hang out and creating several memorable nights; to Cierra for a very special afternoon celebrating German culture; to Dave Johnson for letting us on his dominating and cleverly-but-not-insensitively-named trivia team; to Jason and Jacqueline for letting us spend time with their adorable child (and being great commiseraters in that whole huge-life-changes thing); and Dan Gormally and his new wife for one of the best weddings I've ever been to (the fun at which was ably assisted by John Miller, Nick Metheny, and many, many others). You all make me so happy I can't even come up with a single suitably sarcastic comment. I love you guys.

Message:Don't get me wrong. I feel immense amounts of sympathy for those poor individuals who feel that their lives constitute such a great evil to themselves that they feel it is better to die than to live. I wish dearly that those in that situation would seek help or support. I wish that they would be able to find something to make them know once more that life is a wonderful thing. But mostly at this moment, having cleared snow off of my car for a second time so that I am able to pick up my wife once she arrives at the train station now 2 hours after she was supposed to, I wish they would not choose as their means of departure from this mortal coil the train that she is riding upon.

Story:N/A
Message:Tragically, this weekend was marred by the long-awaited death of my plaid-ish shirt from Buckle (2005-2013). It lived a long existence, but in later years was starting to come apart a bit at the edges. Its demise by satchel-shoulder-strap was shockingly sudden, but humanely quick. 
Though its origins are unclear, it came to the Buckle store in Winston-Salem where I was brought during a solo-visit to my dear brother, Patrick. He and his then-girlfriend, now-wife, Allison brought me there in an attempt to reign my style in from its weird and bizarre oscillations between high-school-power-nerd and wannabe-preppy. To that end, it certainly helped accomplish that goal and was worn consistently over the next eight years, though it itself transitioned from making the fashion statement of ?I?m way too cool for high school? early on to ?this shirt is comfy and I like it? in its last days. But for all its stylistic achievements, it made its most lasting impact as a metaphor. It transcended the genre of clothing to become a symbol for a relationship that at times was strained by distance, but never severed; something that needed renewing but not recovering, needed re-strengthening, but not reestablishing. It was clothing, but also meaning, substance, and even love. And like all good symbols, it recognized that the thing it symbolized remains, even after the symbol has become torn, tattered and (in this case) shows off a rather lamentable section of my torso. 
Shirt, requiescat in pace. You will be missed.

I merely want to encourage you to be informed as you choose whether or not to see the movie.

Story:N/A
Message:I hadn't seen or heard too much about the new Noah movie coming out, aside from a few previews (that I admittedly only paid about 25% of my attention to).  I was undecided whether or not to try to go see it.  If you are undecided (or already planning to see it), perhaps these posts [There are 2 links at the end of this post.] by folks, just like you & me, will help you, as they did me, decide NOT to see it.  What a travesty that Hollywood treats God & His Scripture in such ways.  I, for one, do not intend to see this movie & in so doing, financially support it, its portrayal, its director, etc.  What you do is up to you; I just ask you to be informed.  I'm thankful that those who've seen the movie are speaking up & sharing their perceived inaccuracies & the Truth!

Story:N/A
Message:Oh!!  This is sickening & absolutely horrible!  I'm not a Verizon costumer anymore (for completely unrelated reasons), but if I was, I would seriously considered changing any & all services through them...whether or not it's your television.  At least there are some people/groups standing up to them!

?...Not all content is desirable to or appropriate for all consumers, however, and Verizon is proud to provide our customers with myriad tools to control the types of content that they and their families have access to through our service.? -- Actually, sir, any & all of that content is in appropriate for all consumers!!
?...It would be pretty impossible for Verizon to satisfy every different view of morality while actually serving consumer needs.? -- Interesting theory, ma'am.  Pretty sure any pornography, including adults, children, incest, & anyone(or thing) else is & never was a "need" for anyone; it's a sinful desire & temptation given into.

Message:I was sitting down in a local eatery and I overheard the television hanging behind me. A fella was talking about ferguson and he compared it to about 6 totally unrelated things...trying to prove that the fault is on the citizens alone, and not the police.  Before I turned around I said "Fox News...only Fox News would rely on their audience being this incredibly dumb/uneducated in rhetoric."  And sure enough...Fox News.  Chris Antzoulis = world class deductionist

Message:I was nominated by Dimitrios Karkatselos and family, to do the #ALS #Icebucketchallenge.  I donated to the cause this morning as well. And I'd like to nominate 5 others for the ice bucket challenge: Jeffrey Peterson, Teagan O'Bar, Erin LoCascio (whose last name I still pronounced incorrectly), Frank Antzoulis, and F?bio Valle.  You guys have 24 hours to complete the challenge or donate $100 to the cause.  It's also nice if you donate a little anyways. Thanks Louie Mastrocola for filming and Alexia for cheering me on with your mommy and bruddah.

Message:So...I fell asleep on the N train today after being up late last night. Luckily, I woke up at 42nd st...one stop before I get off.  Immediately after my eyes opened, the lady sitting next to me said "what the fuck do you think you're doing?"   My response was "huh?!".  She then told me that my foot had been rubbing up against her leg. My response was "What?!".  Then, the girl standing in front of me said, "your shoe was touching her ankle while you were sleeping and it was bothering her."  With her tone, I could tell she was on my side lol.  But then this lady went for gold. "I need your name and phone number, because this shit is sexual harassment."  My response was "What!?".  Followed by "I was asleeeeep. If I was bothering you, why didn't you tap my shoulder or say excuse me?"  She didn't respond to my good sense and reason...she just kept saying she wanted my information.  I got out at my stop and walked away from her...with some haste.  She caught up to me and started tapping my shoulder and said "excuse me, you can't just walk away, you were inappropriately touching me."  I said "lady, this is the New York subway during rush hour. People are always up against me.  And awkwardly touching.  But in our case, I was sleeping. My foot rubbed your ankle...and you are freaking out for no reason."  She then got in front of me and started poking my chest and said "listen, that was sexual harassment. I need your information because I didn't want to be touched like that and you can't get away with that. I know what you were tryin to do."  I told her "to stop poking me."  She said "ah you don't like it when it happens to you."  I said "this is intentional."  And I walked right through her.  I came above ground in Herald Square...she was still right behind me.  I walked up to the first officer I saw.  I said "excuse me, this lady is bothering me. I fell asleep on the train and my shoe rubbed against her leg.  She told me that she wants my name and number because she feels sexually harassed. I refused multiple times to give it to her."  He looked at her and said "Miss, please go on your way."  She said "No".  He then told me, "Sir, go on your way, and you (the lady) stay here with me."   

ANGER.  
But it's still a beautiful day minus crazy fuckin people.

Thanks to your kindness we are giving a full scholarship to a student who dropped out at the beginning because his family couldn't afford the trip. Please help us inspire our students with a small contribution. And don't forget to use the code INSPIRE! The code expires tomorrow! Let's make a miracle happen :)

So proud of the entire Ask Big Questions team, especially my friend, colleague, and Rabbi, Josh Feigelson.

"When we start with a big question, we?re building empathy among the students. The hope is that the students will look at the world differently, in a way that allows them to receive each person as they are, and engage in conversation, instead of just argument, debate or even violence."

"The ideal girlfriend/wife. Jenna is drop dead gorgeous and possesses a plethora of amazing qualities. Not only is she stunningly beautiful on the outside, but she's an utter beauty on the inside as well with a heart of gold". 

Also defined as "The little girl you keep in your pocket because she is awesome".

Message:Still looking for a car. Private sales west of Chapel Hill (e.g., Charlotte) seem to be much much cheaper (~$2,000 less). I'm wondering if it's worth driving that far away to look at some. My biggest concern is that I probably wouldn't be able to get it looked at by my mechanic because it's so far away, but I would be able to do something like Carfax. Has anyone done this before? Thoughts? Also, if you know anyone selling a 2-5 year old Toyota or Honda for a great price, please let me know! If I don't find anything in the next week, I'll probably go to a dealership.

 And those golden faces are under 25
 They wanna say, they gonna tell ya

 You better listen now you've said your bit-a

 You're sick of that kind of crap
 But you'd better listen man
 Because the kids know where it's at

 And I've heard they now have the right to kill a man

Message:Thank you Remy Liza Rubin for nominating me for the #alsicebucketchallenge. I am also donating and I encourage you to do so as well at alsa.org. I nominate Eyal Engel, Uri Snyder, Rob Saul, and Liz Henderson. You have 24 hours to complete the challenge or donate $100. Since I'm sending this to a couple of my brothers in Israel, I will also be donating to the Michael Levin Lone Soldier Center and I encourage everyone to do the same.

Message:Thanks to my favorite brother/future counsel David Zachary for nominating me to take the #icebucketchallenge to raise awareness and funds for ALS research. I took the opportunity to go on a one-woman philanthropy spree and sent some love over to NY Presbyterian and Sloan Kettering in honor of Aunt Elyn, JR and Mark and in memory of Jackie, Grandma Muriel and Peter, because I'm also pretty fucking sick of cancer. I challenge Ali Elbert and Andrew J Elbert, Evan Jeffrey, Emily Moorstein and Dana Sperber: write some nice checks to the causes dear to your hearts and tell your mothers you love them! Xo

Message:What?? It's somebody's birthday?? Only the coolest dad ever!! This man is amazing!! Not only a great dad but just a total badass goal achieving hero! Randy Hennessy has made these last few years about becoming even more amazing and he has succeeded in inspiring me and our whole family!  Mom is doing amazing at singing,  Logan,  Caitie,  and I are off nicotine! Cate wins though,  but we're on her tail,  and Meggie is a great mother and caring member of the medical field.  I say,  good sir,  well  done.  And thank you for propelling us to be better people year after year.  You surely are not only an amazing dad but an awe-inspiring person. We are all so lucky to have you and I look forward to the many more birthday wishes for you to come.  Sure do love you  Randal!  Wish I was there to give you a big hug and kiss but I'll be sending them to you all day, just like always! I love you. And happy birthday.

Message:Got up early this AM, to enjoy the beautiful sunrise.  I don't take them for granted, there was a time not too long ago I thought I wouldn't see too many more.  But Thank to God, I'm sitting poolside with a cuppa java and able to give thanks.  Tomorrow at this time AIM at MELANOMA CHESAPEAKE 5K will be well underway.  Tents and tables, balloons and signs, Survivors and Runners getting registered, all for the pleasure of KICKING MELANOMA to the CURB!  I've lost many friends along the way, I've made many new friends on my Cancer Journey.  I have been blessed many times over by this horrific disease.  So this beautiful AM, after the thunder, rain and tornadoes, I thanks my husband Randy Hennessy, my kids, Caitie Hennyhamer, Ay Bodenhamer, Kelly Hennessy, Christopher Hartstein, Logan Hennessy, Megan Hennessy.  My friends,  Rev. Carol Taylor, Dawn Wilkinson, L.l. Henderson, Valarie Flye Keller, Winnie Backman, Tricia Daffron Chappell, Kat Chappell, Maureen Mulcahy Francher, Beth Brooker, Rose O, Coco Prost, W Berkley Gibbs, Debbie Ritter?These have to be the BEST Volunteers in the U*N*I*V*E*R*S*E.  I am the LUCKY REDHEAD.  <3 <3 <3

Message:One day I hope to reflect a life of such similarity to these amazing people. It's incredible how much our Tuttle family has changed in a few short years; from the trials to triumphs the love that began from these two individuals has continued and radiates through the generations. I will forever miss the moments with Grandpa Bill- basketball practice in the Quancit, drives to the cabin, gathering firewood, fishing trips, and many more. His voice continues to be remembered as I would leave his house or end a phone call- "We sure love you Garrett", and "I'm sure proud of you" fill my heart with deep emotion. The house where so many childhood memories- playing house, spook allies in the basement, ping pong tournaments, forts in "the pit", and many hours spent around the table playing games, now will be just a memory to relive in years to come. The greatest lesson I've come to learn from my amazing grandparents has been this- that no matter what situation is thrown at you, you will always have the love and support of family, and that in itself is enough to live on. To my Grandma Tuttle- I love you, our dominating companionship at "500" will continue, my hand will always be there to hold, and there's so much excitement to be had in the future. She's one amazing woman, and the example she demonstrates of love, endurance, strength, and determination are attributes that I will one day hope to pass on to my children. As new chapters continue to begin, and past ones come to an end; the love of family never dies. I love you guys so incredibly much.

It only took shipping the wrong replacement part to the service place 3 times, submitting our case for approval 4 times, calling you 20+ plus times, spending hours on the phone, and only making us wait almost 2 months!

Message:I took a grand adventure in the land of AM radio this afternoon. Not only did I learn that white men sometimes get angry at people who disagree with them, I also learned that terrorists are liberals and that letting gays get married is a trick from satan to test your obedience to God (that only Americans don't seem to get). But the most important thing I learned is that Christian drama is the funniest thing a person can listen to.

Message:We are finally in Hawaii! Our two connections one day flying turned into all day at airport (8hr delay after waking at 3:30am to get to airport at 5am) reroute to CLT nc (running to make connection almost missed it) then to LAX airport then shuttle to overnight hotel...5 hrs of sleep with Zachary's foot in my face...woke up 4am back to airport security again 2hr delay and then 5 1/2 hr flight to hawaii! 

Craziness seems to follow us but I have the most AMAZING boys and hubby!!!

Both boys took all the punches and long waits and flights as a adventure! No meltdowns and Oli only cried once for milk before boarding  the plane!! Zachary's first meltdown complaining was when we were picking up our rental car bc he couldn't ride the city bus again ;( haha

Message:If something's really important to you, you should check on it once a day. Just having it fresh in your mind is a good way of increasing personal accountability. It's one of those 1% gains (http://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains) and these add up. If accomplishing a goal requires meeting certain people, keep a google spreadsheet of these names open in a tab and keep the tab close to the tabs of other services you frequent (email, facebook, hackernews -- whatever your vice is). Piggy back off these services.

I keep the following chrome tabs always pinned and in order:
Calendar | Work Email | Personal Email | People Spreadsheet | Trello | Phabricator.

I maintain a second, dedicated chrome instance of interesting articles, wikipedia pages, research topics, academic papers, and other acceptable "distractions". Refer to my FB post on May 6th (on my timeline) about my rules regarding this chrome instance -- "Note to self: Every time I read a link (or at least for some class / category of resource) I should need to write a sentence as to why I am visiting the link, what it accomplishes, and what tangible value it adds. This exercise (increased friction) should be justified (or rather exceeded) by the relative value of the resource." I try to do this, adding it to a file called common.org which I treat as my emacs org-mode common book (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book)

I devote 4 hours every week to solving a non-work related problem. Generally this is the Great Conversation Congress (GCC) with Drew Winget et al, volunteer some hacks @ Internet Archive, monthly **KWARGS Academic Reading Group Sessions, or open source projects on github.

I also devote 4 hours every week to meeting with others who are solving a problem I am passionate about but (must admit) don't have the time to solve well myself. The lesson here is, talk about your ideas and mention what sort of help you need -- maybe I can help.

I try to formalize my ideas on philosophy into essays at least 2 hours a week. This is generally inspired by something Mark P Neyer, Drew, or Noam Samuel says. I don't think this process has resulted in any new insights to the world, but it has led me towards better understanding of why the world is the way it is and how I might act accordingly. Sometimes I just need to think about the topic sufficiently and understand what questions I want to ask -- such conversations typically lead me to discover a topic which someone else has thought or written about is much greater depth. This is an example of such a short form essay (more on productivity than philosophy)

Message:in a modified Turing Test, would the ability of another computer to distinguish between human and computer interlocutors also be subject to P=NP issues?  I mean, would a suitably powerful computer be able to distinguish between human-based random responses and pseudo-random responses, or would it be the same problem of trying to work backwards from responses that have already been "salted and hashed", so to speak?

Story:N/A
Message:i read this on a jesuit blog and thought of you.  particularly his difficulty in deciding how to fight against injustices because he can't find a prescriptive/descriptive model of the world (reality) that makes sense to him.  i know you're coming at this from different angles; his milieu is clearly one that accepts and depends on a constant God giving order to the universe; but it seems to me that your journeys are somewhat parallel.

"Now, in the interest of full-disclosure, I have a confession: I was not born a revolutionary. Nor would I claim to be one now. I am still not completely clear about the various ideologies of the ?99%? movement and I am not really a fan of the Tea Party. Regarding current events, I am somewhat embarrassed to say that I only keep loose tabs on what is happening in Egypt and Syria, and I am not entirely sure what to make of Edward Snowden. I am a little nervous about the ?NSA domestic spying? business, I am apprehensive about the ways that police units are starting to look like paramilitary forces, and I am pretty pissed off by the prospect of large corporations juicing consumers for cash while also destroying the environment.4 Unfortunately, it is difficult for me to find a way of working to fight injustices in the world because there are so few ways of seeing the world that I can agree with. I look to the world around me, for some kind of unifying vision, but I just end up dismayed at the dissent among the so-called ?guardians? of our social philosophy."

Message:Brilliant thoughts from the always-brilliant Navah Kogen:

"I've refrained from political posts the past few weeks, and I hope this won't be misconstrued as one. 

Struggling so much with all of the loss of life from so many armed conflicts around the world. Struggling nearly as much with the certainty with which activists from all corners of the political spectrum assign both blame and absolute truth.

Posting this not to distract from or diminish the horrendous loss of life going on in Gaza, but rather as a reminder that there are so many people - Israeli, Palestinian, Syrian, and others - dying right now, and we cannot be selective in deciding which of those losses deserve our mourning and our respect. 

"The Washington bureau chief of Al-Hayat, Joyce Karam, was one of the few people to notice the weekend death toll in Syria. She tweeted, in reference to anti-Israel protests in Pakistan, 'Syria is essentially Gaza x320 death toll, x30 number of refugees, but no protest in Pakistan?'. 

I asked her why she thought this is so. Her answer: 'Only reason I can think of is Muslim killing Muslim or Arab killing Arab seems more acceptable than Israel killing Arabs.'"

Message:I rarely like to use social media as a political platform. The terrible things happening in Israel/Gaza/West Bank should make any decent and peace-loving person upset. I am deeply offended, however, when attacks from Hamas are labeled as "Palestinian" while attacks from Israel are labeled as "Jewish." 

It also seems that a lot of people are selectively outraged at Israel/Palestine but are suspiciously quiet about other human suffering elsewhere throughout the world. Because I will never truly understand society's obsession with the Israel/Palestine conflict, here is a reminder of other horrible human sufferings that I never seem to hear any discussion about:

Russia and Ukraine
Shiites and Sunnis
Northern Mali
Mozambique
North Korea and South Korea
China
South Sudan
Nigeria
Somalia
Central African Republic
Hungary 
Etc.

They announced this at the Cruz Azul / Pumas game they sponsored at Soldier Field. That building has been a curse to sports teams having once housed now defunct Chicago Express Hockey, Chicago Hounds Hockey, Chicago Shamrox Lacrosse, Chicago Slaughter Football, Chicago Storm Soccer, and Chicago Soul Soccer. I hope they continue to build off of last year's success and break the Sears Centre curse. It's a big place seating more than 8,000 with the field down.

Message:ATTENTION anyone who is 18 to 30: I attempted to get around to everybody this morning, but I'm sure I missed some people. Julia Gibson, Chris Peterson, and Brenda Arnold Peterson are planning an event of the year THIS Friday (March 28) at 6:30pm. 

"Get dressed up (be sure to wear something green) and come out to a free dinner and dinner entertainment at the Blacksburg Church of Christ. If you have a significant other, be sure to bring them along." 

There will be a fancy dinner and world class entertainment (haha)! So go all out and have fun with your dress!

I promise you will not regret coming because it is going to be basically awesome! :) 

Make sure to RSVP, so we know how many to cook for. Also, let us know if you have dietary restrictions (aka vegetarian, non-dairy, tree-nuts...). 

RSVP to either yrg26@vt.edu or jeg210@vt.edu.

Sorry about the insanely long message!

Since the ladies are having a girls night, the guys will be having a guys night. This Saturday at the River house. That's Nathan Sigmon's house in Radford. We can carpool if anyone wants a ride. Thinking awesome movie, maybe the fire pit outside. If folks want to grab some grub before hand I'm up for that as well. Movie ideas? I'm thinking Die Hard 3, Kung Pow, or something equally funny, intense, and/or action packed. Please comment if you're going below.

Time 7, unless you want to grab food, then 5:30 in Radford.

Message:This past weekend one of my dear friends and coaches earned the title of National Weightlifting Champion for the second year in a row. It is not only amazing to see friends succeed but especially people who do in fact EARN their achievements. I'm beyond  ecstatic to see someone who doesn't cut corners, who is humble (ignore his banners up everywhere), and while in his own journey continues to support other peoples dreams. Our society is all about the short cuts these days but nothing beats hard work, good character and dedication. Congratulations Caine !

Message:Six months ago, I was suddenly laid off from the best job I had thus far. Amidst the stress, anger and unknown of what to do next with my life I went on a date to meet a guy at a hole in the wall karaoke bar. I had no reason to believe it would be any different than the myriad of dates I'd been on previously. That was the night I met David Schuberth. Since then, we have fallen in love with each other and my world has become much more bright and fun. Happy six months David. I love you so much! :)

Message:Let me see how this turns out: It occurs to me that for each and every one of you on my friends list, I catch myself looking at your pictures, sharing jokes and news, as well as support during good and bad times. I am also happy to have you among my friends. We will see who will take the time to read this message until the end. If... you appreciate your friends and family... from all over the world. I'm going to be watching to see who takes care of the friendship, just like me. Thank you all for being a part of my life. DON'T SHARE!! Once you respond, I will inbox you this post for you to copy then paste on your wall so I can leave a word for you. So, if you read this, leave ONE WORD AS TO HOW WE MET. Only ONE word or should I say; ONE WORD ONLY!!

While I was unable to move the majority of cardboard standees, banners, mylars and other memorabilia to the west coast with me, I've built a much smaller version of the shrine to keep me company. It now entails my poster signed by many of my friends, maquettes from the film courtesy of friends I deeply love and admire, and an original background painting from the movie (which cost me many months of paper route earnings to buy at Sotheby's.) I hope I never forget how much this film and its makers inspired me.

I have a room available right now in my 3 bedroom 2.5 bath townhouse in a gated neighborhood off Michigan Ave (https://goo.gl/maps/6lwuy). Bedroom is about 13ft by 11 ft, unfurnished, and has a decent sized closet. Both the bedroom and bathroom are on the second floor. There is an off-street parking spot available. Condo has a dishwasher, washer and dryer. Planning to keep the third bedroom as a guest room. Rent would be $1100 plus utilities but that is sort of open to discussion. Please contact me if you or anyone you know is interested. You can find more info here:

Message:Meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beer's in the fridge
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Games on the tube and Daddy smokes cigars
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss
In a world gone crazy as this

Message:I'm starting a new "thing" tonight. It will be the Children's / YA Book of the Day. Today's is "The Boy Who Was Raised by Librarians". 

This morning I read "The Boy Who Was Raised By Librarians". It made me teary eyed. It's such a wonderful book: the story, the art, and especially, as a librarian influenced by wonderful librarians (ahem, Linda Houston and Leigh Kostis) it was a story I identified with as well. 

The people we meet, who teach us, challenge us and mentor us (Congrats, again, Jackie Novotny, for Mentor of the Year!) have such a huge affect on our futures, and this book is a wonderful tribute to those people.

My Mamaw is moving into an apartment next month and she is not able to bring her dog. She doesn't want to put her dog back into a shelter, therefore she has decided it would be best to put the dog down unless someone takes her. If anyone knows my Mamaw she is very stubborn so there is no convincing her otherwise. She is willing to give the dog away to a good home so please let me know if you or someone you know is interested.
Daisy is a 7 year old corgi mix. She is very sweet and loyal. She has had a couple of seizures in her life but nothing that is life threatening.

Although I'm not there, I am giving you an air hug and kiss right now (in the middle of my classroom with my students and co-teacher staring at me).  But, it's worth it, because it's, like, your birthday!  
But, for real, Happy Birthday!!!  I miss you and hope everything thing is going well.  Love you,

Story:N/A
Message:Great management by The Special One.. "taking the pressure off his players again" now by blaming Hazard for the defeat.. all part of the masterplan, no doubt.. which is after the other masterplan of claiming he had no good strikers.. which, again, is taking the pressure off.. and lowering expectations.. despite 106m spent.. but heh, they're "little horses" right.. not ready yet.. all about next season, after Roman gives you another 100m, then you'll be ready to compete with the bigs boys, eh Jose.. blah, blah, blah, blaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh.. the Mourinho show is such a tired act now.. he's just lucky he's got an open chequebook to buy the perfect parts to his Bus. And admittedly, he's the best Bus conductor in the world.

Message:Normally I don't pay attention to websites such as this one, but the video speaks for itself. Whatever else you've heard about Ferguson and the mess there, it seems clear the police value protecting one of their own above honesty.

It's not graphic, but it might be disturbing. You can see how he comes walking in a roundabout way towards the officers and then falls over, but not much else.

What I want to know, is why did the officers immediately have their weapons drawn when they showed up? Is that normal police protocol in the US for a possible armed (with a knife) robbery?

Message:Just started the latest book of the Laundry Files by Charles Stross. I had forgotten the sheer joy of his ludicrously imaginative world.

I'm only like 20 pages in, and the main character (an applied computational demonologist) is already programming a zombie to make a suicide attack with a basilisk gun on an extradimensional eldritch abomination that was the accidental result of his old manager's 10% project. 

And when I say programming, I mean he defined a subroutine called basilisk_grenade(), and used pointers and method calls. In a language created by an extinct race that apparently died out long before dinosaurs walked the earth. Which you can speak out loud, to zombies even. Who are actually deceased employees being ridden by little subsentient entities from other universes.

Fun. :D

You were so right about the food! It was never ending and actually really good, healthy food! They also had scooter stations on every "corner" and there was a gym AND random places for people to sleep when they're tired??? There was also a whole floor with legos with a random section filled with pacman machines????

So essentially what I learned during my tour was that you don't need to find an apartment in NYC since anything and everything you could possibly need can be found in that office...

Message:Alright NBA fans, many apologies if I've overlooked any free-agency threads, but I wanted to take the opportunity to get a conversation started. It should shape up to be an interesting off-season with so many big-name players' futures up in the air.

For the Hornets, I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing if we don't go out and get a "star" player. We already have an All-Star-caliber Center in Al Jefferson, which is a very rare commodity in today's NBA. Arguably, the Hornets also have had the most successful draft in 2.0-era/Bobcats franchise history. There's a bright future in Charlotte, and I think the franchise would serve itself well by bringing back McRoberts and finding a decent backup PG.

That being said, what are everyone's thoughts on NBA free-agency?

Message:So I lost my ipod and I have an Android phone.  I downloaded Double Twist and am getting my podcasts now which is great.  However, my phone's battery life usually doesn't last me long enough.  And, when I had to wipe my hard drive all of the paths to play the music on my computer got messed up so when I ask itunes to play something it can't find it.  So...
-do I get another ipod and try to tediously reorganize the music on my computer?
-download Double Twist onto my computer (makes me v. nervous virus wise) and then try to get it onto my phone?
-forget the music in itunes and start fresh.  I'm ready for some new stuff anyway but need someone to suggest my best bet for downloading music.
-come up with some other genius idea one of you will suggest.

Thanks!!!

I want a laptop with a 14 in. screen and it'd be great if it also converted into an i-pad type device. 

Trying to decide between a PC that is convertible or buying the Apple Macbook Pro and an iPad which wont be as cost efficient.

With so many people posting video such as the ice bucket challenge, the video was automatically playing as I scrolled through the news feed. Since I went to settings and turned off video auto play in facebook, my daily data usage has dropped to nearly zero! Just thought I'd pass along the information. Happy Facebook surfing!

-Timmy's stank face after Kawhi's tip slam in game 4 and his head rub on Manu after Manu's jam in game 5
-Timmy's inalienable right to also rub Tony's head
-Kawhi getting mobbed upon receiving the MVP trophy
-Kawhi feeling about the media the way he does about HEB chocolate milk
-Timmy jumping into to D-Rob's arms as if it were '99
-Timmy with his kids; manu with his wife

Message:I did one for Mothers Day so hes one for My Dad,
    When you first had me do yard work and mow the lawn and i didn't feel like doing it i would dump the grass clippings all over the yard and spread them around with my feet instead of throwing them away. Also you ever noticed how the leaves never pile up on the hill where you dump them down? Yeah that's been about 8 years of me just raking them under the front and back porches. I do it not only to get the job done faster but also because you always seem to rake under the decks when i conveniently have to work, or I'm not home. So its a win win for me and you. I get done quickly and no more yard work for me, while you like doing yard work and have something to do. So technically you cant be mad at me because 1. You would have done the same thing at my age and 2. I also have already bribed you with gifts. Love you Dad, Happy Fathers Day Joseph Bartel

I proceeded to get so scared you would find out that I hid them in my closet and proceeded to sneak them into the trash without incident. I would have have killed me in your shoes, and that's why i thank you mother for being understanding even 12 years later. Although it helps my cause since i have already bribed you with flowers and chocolate. Im am not a clever man, nor a gardener but your there for me anyway.  Happy Mothers Day Kristan Kelley Bartel.

Story:N/A
Message:CNN audio recording reckons Michael Brown shot in two bursts of gunfire in Ferguson, Missouri. First seven seven shots, second four shots. 3/4 second pause between. Must have been hit at least twice in the first burst as he was hit six times. So what's the justification for the second round of gunfire? The final shot was through the top of the head.

Message:Anyone interested in why the press didn't print allegations Jimmy Savile was a necrophiliac and paedophile back when they were first made may want to read this. The Sun accused this man of abusing children. He sued and won ?70k but the story triggered more victims to come forward. Now he's been jailed for life for child abuse.

Seriously, 15 years later...I tear up just thinking about that morning. it's purdy. happy trails!

THE WICHITA EAGLE-BEACON

LARGE FAMILY REQUIRED LOVE OF HUGE SPIRIT
Sunday, June 19, 1988
By BILL BARTEL, STAFF WRITER
 
William R. Bartel Sr. was 10 feet tall, king of the hill and god in his house.
I know, because he told me these facts every week of my young life.
What an ego. If you don't believe me, just ask my brothers - Robert William, Timothy William, Joseph William and Francis William.
He was a man of huge spirit trapped in the body of Don Knotts. A hey-how-ya-doin' kind of guy who always put his arm around whoever he was talking to.
If you were around him for 15 minutes you knew two things: He smoked incessantly - the world was his ashtray - and he thought my mother was the most beautiful woman on Earth.
His love affair with Mom was a never-ending heavy date. Ballroom dancing, flowers for no reason, necking on the sofa - you get the picture.
In addition to five sons, my parents also had five daughters. It was fewer kids than the dozen they planned, but they learned to live with it.
Mom was the healer of physical and spiritual wounds.
Pop was the general. He embarrassed us with his finger-snap commands as he trooped us into church. A regular ritual before our annual trip to a nice restaurant was for Dad to threaten us with serious bodily harm if we misbehaved. We were so polite that other patrons bought us rounds of soda.
With that many mouths to feed, our family was always living on the financial edge, but I never knew it. I thought everyone's father bought a entire cow and butchered it with the help of his squeamish kids. Having one bathroom for 12 people seemed perfectly normal.
A lot if it, I think, was attitude. My father was always so sure about everything. He and Mom made us feel that we were part of something special.
Whether it was taking turns learning to dance on the tops of his feet to tunes from the Lawrence Welk Show or traveling across the country in a camper inscribed with "THE BARTEL FAMILY" in huge letters, Dad was making sure his family was growing up together.
He taught by example that manhood has more to do with honesty and open affection than physical strength or stoicism. My brothers and I never stopped kissing him on the lips when we grew into men.
He wanted so much for his sons and daughters to be like him. But when we went our own ways, our dreams became his.
A lifelong jock, he tried teaching me to throw a fastball. When I left my glove to rot on the lawn while I read books, he never showed his disappointment. Instead, he built a bookshelf and installed a reading lamp above my bed.
Decades later, when I was a dirt-poor college student, he tried to give me spending money when I was home for the holidays. But, like him, I was too stubborn to take unearned money.
I ended up getting a job at a neighborhood store. It was only a few months ago that I learned Dad had convinced the store owner to offer me that job and paid the guy enough money to cover my salary.
My father died two years ago last April 5 the way every good man should go: cradled in the arms of the woman he loved. He had a smile on his face and an enviable belief in his bones that he knew exactly where he was going.
It's funny how as time passes I understand Dad so much more clearly. Late at night when I look in on my own sleeping sons, I feel what he felt and worry the way he worried. It pains me that I can't tell him about it.
I guess I'll have to be content to teach my kids how to dance on the tops of my feet.
I think Pop would like that.

Now that my children have given me this very cool tablet as a b-day gift I'm actually participating in social media instead just looking over Isobel's shoulder at her page.

Message:Hey everybody. This is your fearless leadership, reporting in for a final post. 

It's been a fantastic run, these three years. Myself, Dierker, and Brady started this out of a freshman dorm room and a pulled apart light switch. We went on to scrounge together enough people for a total hack of an indoor display that put smiles on so many kids' faces. 

That second year, I'd never seen so many volunteers come out of the woodwork to pitch in a hand. Even though it didn't work out in the end, we learned so much. We built a great team, and the friendships made those weeks are built to last. 

Our final year, with no funding, no resources, and a blown fuse with two hours to go, we pulled out our biggest win yet. Over the course of two days, more than two hundred came through our door to watch and be DJ. Through our hard work, we made Engineering Open House just a little but more magical. 

I want to thank everyone here for your invaluable contributions these years. We couldn't have done it without you. PRI is now entering maintenance mode, until the day someone chooses to breathe life into it once again ;) 

Thanks everybody. It's been a hell of a ride. Rock on!

Story:N/A
Message:Ruthann Figlestahler, I woke up thinking about Mothers Day this coming weekend and I remembered Ryan Fig s post. This is for you and all Moms including my own, Joan Rafferty.  

By the time the Lord made woman,
He was into his sixth day of working overtime.
An angel appeared and said,
"Why are you spending so much time on this one?"
And the Lord answered, "Have you seen my spec sheet on her?
She has to be completely washable, but not plastic,
have over 200 movable parts, all replaceable
and able to run on diet coke and leftovers,
have a lap that can hold four children at one time,
have a kiss that can cure anything from a scraped knee to a broken heart
-and she will do everything
with only two hands."

The angel was astounded at the requirements.
"Only two hands!? No way!
And that's just on the standard model?
That's too much work for one day.
Wait until tomorrow to finish."

"But I won't," the Lord protested.
"I am so close to finishing this creation that is so close to my own heart.
She already heals herself when she is sick
AND can work 18 hour days."

The angel moved closer and touched the woman.
"But you have made her so soft, Lord."

"She is soft," the Lord agreed,
"but I have also made her tough.

You have no idea what she can endure or accomplish."

"Will she be able to think?", asked the angel.

The Lord replied,
"Not only will she be able to think,
she will be able to reason and negotiate."

The angel then noticed something,
and reaching out, touched the woman's cheek.
"Oops, it looks like you have a leak in this model.
I told you that you were trying to put too much into this one."

"That's not a leak,"
the Lord corrected,
"that's a tear!"
"What's the tear for?" the angel asked.

The Lord said, "The tear is her way of expressing her joy,
her sorrow, her pain, her disappointment, her love,
her loneliness, her grief and her pride."
The angel was impressed.
"You are a genius, Lord.
You thought of everything!
Woman is truly amazing."

And she is!
Women have strengths that amaze men.
They bear hardships and they carry burdens,
but they hold happiness,
love and joy.
They smile when they want to scream.
They sing when they want to cry.
They cry when they are happy
and laugh when they are nervous.
They fight for what they believe in.
They stand up to injustice.
They don't take "no" for an answer
when they believe there is a better solution.
They go without so their family can have.
They go to the doctor with a frightened friend.
They love unconditionally.
They cry when their children excel
and cheer when their friends get awards.
They are happy when they hear about
a birth or a wedding.
Their hearts break when a friend dies.
They grieve at the loss of a family member,
yet they are strong when they think there is no strength left.
They know that a hug and a kiss
can heal a broken heart.
Women come in all shapes, sizes and colors.
They'll drive, fly, walk, run or e-mail you
to show how much they care about you.
The heart of a woman is what makes the world keep turning.
They bring joy, hope and love.
They have compassion and ideals.
They give moral support to their family and friends.
Women have vital things to say and everything to give.

HOWEVER, IF THERE IS ONE FLAW IN WOMEN,

IT IS THAT THEY FORGET THEIR WORTH.

Message:In all of my trials, tribulations, travels, moves, joys, and pains, many things are constantly in change for me as a young man. That being said, the Mass has always been a place of great comfort for me. No matter what changes is my life, I have been granted the greatest gift, experiencing a taste of the Kingdom of Heaven, on a weekly basis with my community .

There is much strength in realizing that no matter what changes in my life Christ is always waiting for me in the Eucharist.  I have much gratitude to those who helped me to realize the power of this greatest gift at so early in my life.  Give this gift to someone else.

Message:My big brother, Bill Bartel, wrote this tribute to my dad several years ago.  My dad was an amazing man and taught me to put family above all else.  He taught me the meaning of unconditional love.  He gave me the best gift ever, 9 beautiful brothers & sisters! Everyday I try to make him proud and I know he is watching and guiding each and everyone of us.  Even thought this is my 28th Father's Day without him....I will always celebrate this day in my heart with him because he is forever right there!

I asked him why I was all the way at the bottom. He replied,  "that's the most important part of the tree,  you are the most important part of the family"  

Brought me to tears, hearing my 6 year old say that.

Message:so, i'm sitting in my room at the hostel when a guy asks if anyone has been to the philippines. i say that i have and he asks me what i thought. i tell him it's beautiful and the beaches are great, but the food is disappointing. he says that he's heard that there's Spanish influence and asks me if that's true. i pause and i start giggling. then, i say, "well, i say this only because my half Filipino friend said this, but Filipinos are like the Mexicans of Asia." 

*DEAD SILENCE* then, a polite, but pitied chuckle. 

this is my life. 

miss you pocahontas kitty kat! xoxo

You are so much more than just a mom; you're my best friend, my confidant, the hand that smacks me when I'm being stupid, guides me when I'm lost and holds mine when I want to give up. I love to the moon and back and don't know where I would be without you. Thank you x infinity for everything.

Message:Cincinnati friends. 

I'm looking for some additional landscape work. New installs, pruning, mulching, project type of work. Not looking for mowing or anything that involves being at a property regularly. 

As most of you know I'm only landscaping part time right now as I have a full time job and can only take on limited types of work with limited availability due to 1 main client that keeps me busy most of the time. 

With that being said, I have that customer caught up and I'm available for some project type of work for the next month. 

If you or someone you know needs some help the rest of this month, please private message me and we can discuss. 

Thanks,
Ted

Message:4 word review: Good story, bad science.

If you're a runner, you'll like this book. It's filled with great stories about legendary runners, focusing on the Tarahumara tribe in Mexico.

But weird product and idea endorsements are sprinkled throughout the book. These endorsements, including chia seeds and Vibram Five Finger shoes, are backed by carefully selected scientific research that ignores the mass of contradicting studies to, for example, the claim that running barefoot will decrease injury rates.

These wonky endorsements, plus patently unscientific claims like evolution taking place in just 6 generations (pg. 253), made me sort of hate the book.

But the stories of incredible people redeemed it. And quotes that were really just masturbation for runners.

"There was some sort of connection between the capacity to love and the capacity to love running"

"They were body artists, playing with the palette of human endurance."

"If you don't think you were born to run, you're not only denying history. You're denying who you are."

Regardless of the bad science, this book got me to see a new side of running, and had tangible effects on my own running.

Message:"I think great artists and great engineers are similar, in that they both have a desire to express themselves. In fact some of the best people working on the original Mac were poets and musicians on the side. In the seventies computers became a way for people to express their creativity. Great artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were also great at science. Michelangelo knew a lot about how to quarry stone, not just how to be a sculptor"

An empowering book. I wish I'd read this before coming to Carnegie Mellon.

Message:When I was born, Anisha gave me her stuffed dalmatian Pongo. That won me over.

We were the siblings who never fought. We'd bring a tent into our bedroom and have secret dance parties while our parents slept. We invented games like Monkey and Juranamo. We depended on each other when moving towns and changing friends, and talk about anything and everything.We were, and still are, best friends.

I can hardly believe that you're getting married, Anisha. I just have this mental picture of you as this 13 year old, big-glasses, bossy idol of mine. I can't believe you've grown up.

I'm so, so happy for you and Jon. Congratulations!

Looking forward to your recommendations of the best sections of your trip for backpacking, in case I ever actually have funds to make a transoceanic flight myself. 

I figured this link would be pertinent for your travels and may even provide some beneficial fore-knowledge of how not to do (or do...) various things while backpacking around strange and distant lands. Enjoy.

This little film is from the 50's - so clothing and cars look different to day, but the old houses and the beach are the same. There are pictures from a Fan? festival where the people wears the old national clothes - they still do that during the festival. The music is traditional Fan? music.

As some of you now know, I am no longer with the company I was working for. I am now in the market for a new job. I've begun applying to various positions, but I thought I would also put it out there to see if anyone is knows of anything available. My background in school was production, I then worked for 3 years in casting for television and film, and most recently I've worked in digital distribution. If you do know of anything, then send me a message, otherwise if you could keep our family in your thoughts and prayers that would be great too. 

Thanks in advance.

Now I am going for the Super Spartan (8+ miles) and the Spartan Beast (which is an obstacle course half marathon). As much fun as it is to do this alone, its great to do it with friends. If anyone is interested in doing this and/or training with me, the Beast is September 13th. The Super Spartan is October 25 in Sacramento (My wife and I are making a weekend of it). Drop me a message if your interested. 

You don't know what you are capable of until you try!

Name:Immigration reform could be bonanza for Democrats
Story:N/A
Message:This is an example of what peeves me the most about the way the media asses voter trends - it's almost always displayed as a battle of race. This article makes the case that immigration reform means 11 million new Hispanic voters, who will vote Democratic *simply because that's how Hispanics voted in 2012*. 

This perspective is flawed because the circumstances for these voters will be different post-reform than in 2012. Theoretically, most of the 71% voted Dem because they favored immigration reform. Once reform is passed, that will no longer be an issue, and they'll look to their second most important issue. I assume this will be more like white voters and have similar divides, And so not be the "bonanza" this article predicts.

You can't say that Chief Justice Roberts is wrong because "the data doesn't back him up", use data you *assume* he used, mock him for that assumed data set not having relevant information, and then countering by making a claim to the contrary WITH ABSOLUTELY ZERO DATA TO BACK YOURSELF UP. 

Maybe Roberts did the smart thing: hard research, eh? Comparing, I dunno, 2008 and 2012 voter data against 2010 census information? I can't say for sure, but at least my assumption makes a damn bit of sense.

Get arrested for 3 DUIs, 3 felony counts of illegal possession of an assault weapon, and then arrested for saying you have a bomb in an airport = You may have to take a couple of games off.
Fail drug tests = indefinite NFL suspension.

Message:Since you're on a lovely Mexican adventure and I can't text you to tell you this, I wanted to share with you the 2 most important things I've learned in my Linear Algebra class so far before I forget:

1. The true difference between high school and college: My instructor abbreviated "standard" as "std" and no one laughed. Or even smirked. When I tried to do the same thing in my AFM class this semester, my kids were not capable of learning until I wrote out the entire word and erased the hilarious abbreviation.

2. Today we proved why "[A]inverse[B] gives the solution to a system, and I learned what the calculator really means when it says "Err: Singular Matrix." I now feel less guilty teaching this method to my students because at least I understand why it works.

Enough math! I hope you're enjoying your cruise!!

Message:Found out today that TWC is planning to launch TWC Maxx, an upgraded speed service for the same price as regular TWC, in Durham next year. Other markets? Charlotte. Austin. Kansas City, to name a few.

That list of cities look familiar?  If so, it may be because Google Fiber is trying to go to those cities as well.

This is why we shouldn't allow monopolies: The very second competition enters the market, the consumer benefits. This service has existed for a couple of years in areas like New York City, and they held out on us to benefit their own bottom line, and knowing that we had no other good options.

Fuck Time Warner Cable.

Message:if robin williams' untimely passing is bringing mental health awareness to the forefront, i feel i have to stress that robin williams DID NOT have depression. robin williams had bipolar disorder, which is much different from depression and deserves just as much understanding. regardless of which particular mental illness he suffered from, the world has lost a fantastic human being and the sun shines a little weaker this morning. listen to your loved ones, kids. you never know what's coming next.

They really took care of us and we appreciate it.  We live close by and will be back!

#Fairfax City Mayor Scott Silverthorne recently hosted Providence Elementary second-grader Thomas Simione as Mayor for a Day. The son of Cindy and Robert Simione of the Mosby Woods community, Thomas got to visit various City departments to see how they?re run. And during the April 22 City Council meeting, Thomas and Providence kindergartner Abby Killian helped proclaim April as Spring Cleanup Month. Unlike Silverthorne, who was recently re-elected to office, Thomas won the mayor?s role in a raffle.

For those of you like me it means: an animation technique using motion and text to express ideas. If you are sensitive to a little swearing skip this one, otherwise I think it's pretty awesome!!

Message:Geo is snoring so loud right now. I can hear him across the house. He's currently on that post-ODU camp hibernation. When he wakes up, he'll have post-ODU camp sadness, then for the next month he'll continue to look at the pictures (after posting, of course) just to reminisce. Trust me, it happens every year. Lol

What she didn't tell us was she would be taking calls during BOTH act 1 and 2. She didn't even bother going outside, rather answered the calls while receiving a chorus of shush from the surrounding guests. And did I mention that 106 of our guests were pre-teens who made nary a peep?

Message:Ruthann Figlestahler, I woke up thinking about Mothers Day this coming weekend and I remembered Ryan Fig s post. This is for you and all Moms including my own, Joan Rafferty.  

By the time the Lord made woman,
He was into his sixth day of working overtime.
An angel appeared and said,
"Why are you spending so much time on this one?"
And the Lord answered, "Have you seen my spec sheet on her?
She has to be completely washable, but not plastic,
have over 200 movable parts, all replaceable
and able to run on diet coke and leftovers,
have a lap that can hold four children at one time,
have a kiss that can cure anything from a scraped knee to a broken heart
-and she will do everything
with only two hands."

The angel was astounded at the requirements.
"Only two hands!? No way!
And that's just on the standard model?
That's too much work for one day.
Wait until tomorrow to finish."

"But I won't," the Lord protested.
"I am so close to finishing this creation that is so close to my own heart.
She already heals herself when she is sick
AND can work 18 hour days."

The angel moved closer and touched the woman.
"But you have made her so soft, Lord."

"She is soft," the Lord agreed,
"but I have also made her tough.

You have no idea what she can endure or accomplish."

"Will she be able to think?", asked the angel.

The Lord replied,
"Not only will she be able to think,
she will be able to reason and negotiate."

The angel then noticed something,
and reaching out, touched the woman's cheek.
"Oops, it looks like you have a leak in this model.
I told you that you were trying to put too much into this one."

"That's not a leak,"
the Lord corrected,
"that's a tear!"
"What's the tear for?" the angel asked.

The Lord said, "The tear is her way of expressing her joy,
her sorrow, her pain, her disappointment, her love,
her loneliness, her grief and her pride."
The angel was impressed.
"You are a genius, Lord.
You thought of everything!
Woman is truly amazing."

And she is!
Women have strengths that amaze men.
They bear hardships and they carry burdens,
but they hold happiness,
love and joy.
They smile when they want to scream.
They sing when they want to cry.
They cry when they are happy
and laugh when they are nervous.
They fight for what they believe in.
They stand up to injustice.
They don't take "no" for an answer
when they believe there is a better solution.
They go without so their family can have.
They go to the doctor with a frightened friend.
They love unconditionally.
They cry when their children excel
and cheer when their friends get awards.
They are happy when they hear about
a birth or a wedding.
Their hearts break when a friend dies.
They grieve at the loss of a family member,
yet they are strong when they think there is no strength left.
They know that a hug and a kiss
can heal a broken heart.
Women come in all shapes, sizes and colors.
They'll drive, fly, walk, run or e-mail you
to show how much they care about you.
The heart of a woman is what makes the world keep turning.
They bring joy, hope and love.
They have compassion and ideals.
They give moral support to their family and friends.
Women have vital things to say and everything to give.

HOWEVER, IF THERE IS ONE FLAW IN WOMEN,

IT IS THAT THEY FORGET THEIR WORTH.

Our Mom, Joan Rafferty did all of this effortlessly along with baking rolls for breakfast and an Easter dinner for us plus Grandparents. I think the one that is missing from this photo is Joseph Bartel, he either was a newborn or had not arrived yet. Joan Bartel Satterlee and Frank Bartel were not born yet.

Message:Our church cemetery held it's Decoration this past June 1st. If it were not for this sweet lady the cemetery would not look like it does today. She has family here and they live about an hour above Nashville. She came down way back in 1997-98 and saw things needed to be taken care of better.
She made a few phone calls and one call was to my daddy, Robert Austin. Then with those two on board with Lamar Freeman and a few others, I don't remember at this time, made things happen and now we have one of the nicest cemetery's around.
Thanks to them we raised enough money to get the project paid for and an interest in keeping the cemetery looking "first class."
And the only way to keep their dream alive is to keep sending donation along the year as you can. Every dime helps with the upkeep. It the property of Geraldine First Methodist BUT NOT IN THE BUDGET FOR UPKEEP.

I was really looking forward to seeing them and it is always a very nice visit when we see them.
Thank you Mr. Frank Rains and a bigger THANK YOU to Mrs. Mary Rains. God bless you both.

Message:Frank; Great to hear from you. I remember meeting you once when I was a young boy. Paula and I had went to spend a week with dad, and uncle Gurley. I met u again at dad's funeral. It's a shame, I guess, that we don't know each other, but, with different families, easy to not know one another. I have been married for 39 years, have two children, and four grandsons. Caddo is halfway between Decatur and Moulton. Been here 36 years. Drove a truck after I graduated from West Morgan High school for a few years, then worked at 3M of Decatur, until I was injured in the explosion at 3M in 1989. Have been on disability for several years, and have retired. Would love to talk again, any time. ROLL TIDE!!!

I still think about him everyday, and miss him greatly.  I don't think things ended the way any of us thought, or wanted but I hope he knew he was very well loved by many, and influenced a great many lives. It saddens me that he's not here with us to be a part of our lives, but I know and believe he can see us now without anything else getting in the way. I love you Dad.

And I hope you're as thrilled as I am with the signing of Revis! It gives the Pats defense a major push this season. Let's hope they can now get some more weapons somehow for Tom.

Now - let's hope the Men's National Team plays well - as well as DC United!

She's trying to give several promising students the opportunity to attend an intensive summer training program for the newspaper. Life skills, writing, layout, interviewing, ethics - it's all included.  If you can help - great.  If you can just "share" and get the word out - great.  I am in awe of Liz and her colleagues.  They are amazing and the young students they teach so appreciate their passion.

Message:We love our rescued Catahoula Leopard dog (yes, that is a real breed :) ).  She is such a good girl who had a very hard day.  She had to have exploratory surgery today to see why she she hasn't been eating.  (This is after extensive blood tests, X-rays, and a sonogram).  Can't wait for her to come home!

If it doesn't, the family will go into deep depression----and the poor dog, Izod, will be eternally confused.  This was 3 days, but it really seemed longer.............I think the heat was worse than the cold from the winter storm.

Message:I did one for Mothers Day so hes one for My Dad,
    When you first had me do yard work and mow the lawn and i didn't feel like doing it i would dump the grass clippings all over the yard and spread them around with my feet instead of throwing them away. Also you ever noticed how the leaves never pile up on the hill where you dump them down? Yeah that's been about 8 years of me just raking them under the front and back porches. I do it not only to get the job done faster but also because you always seem to rake under the decks when i conveniently have to work, or I'm not home. So its a win win for me and you. I get done quickly and no more yard work for me, while you like doing yard work and have something to do. So technically you cant be mad at me because 1. You would have done the same thing at my age and 2. I also have already bribed you with gifts. Love you Dad, Happy Fathers Day Joseph Bartel

I've made them before and it is a good little snack especially when craving chips!  (I think you can get by with less olive oil but you may just have to play around with it a bit!)
