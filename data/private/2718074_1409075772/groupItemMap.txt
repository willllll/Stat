Name:Computer Science
Description:People should post interesting events/occurrences of Computer Science related things, relevant news articles, stories, discussions about classes and schedules, and anything else you'd like directed towards CS people.

Update on posting policies (from Matthew Leming, 1-5-2014): We will now be deleting the following kinds of posts advertising for group projects:

1. Projects in which interested persons are required to message the poster for further details.
2. Unpaid projects proposed by *individuals* without any computer programming experience (if, say, a local charity wanted to advertise for a dev here, that has a little more clout to it than one student with an idea for an app). If, however, you're a programmer and just need more people on your project, that's A-OK.

Name:2013 Bay Area Summer Interns
Description:This is a group for the people who've accepted offers to intern in the Bay Area for Summer 2013.

Please NO recruiting posts or any posts asking where to find internships or saying you need one. This is for people who ALREADY have internships. It's not meant to be a job search group.

Also PROHIBITED is the posting of anything that seems like its promoting a commercial interest (e.g. don't post about your bar's special, or advertise your restaurant's food, etc). Obviously sometimes it's relevant and that's ok, but most of the time it probably isn't and I'll remove it.
