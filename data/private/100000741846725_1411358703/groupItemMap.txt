Description:There are ridiculous interactions around UNC all the time, and we've all been fortunate enough to be within hearing distance of one at some point or another. Share the wealth, post them here. No ads, promotions, plugs, inappropriate or irrelevant posts; they will be removed and the poster will also be temporarily removed. If you feel you've been improperly removed, please contact the administrators via message and we will be glad to hear you out.

Name:Carolina Cantonese Connection
Description:Carolina Cantonese Connection, a student-run organization open to everyone, is dedicated to bringing together TarHeel students and scholars of Cantonese descent and those interested in Cantonese culture or language at UNC campus. 
CCC will serve as a network and a cultural-learning community for the university by organizing social and educational events to appreciate the beauty of Cantonese culture and language as part of Chinese culture. CCC also aims to create ties with other on-campus cultural-learning organizations and provide opportunities to reach Cantonese community beyond UNC. Ultimately, we hope to promote diversity by adding another unique element to the TarHeel community.

Description:People should post interesting events/occurrences of Computer Science related things, relevant news articles, stories, discussions about classes and schedules, and anything else you'd like directed towards CS people.

Update on posting policies (from Matthew Leming, 1-5-2014): We will now be deleting the following kinds of posts advertising for group projects:

1. Projects in which interested persons are required to message the poster for further details.
2. Unpaid projects proposed by *individuals* without any computer programming experience (if, say, a local charity wanted to advertise for a dev here, that has a little more clout to it than one student with an idea for an app). If, however, you're a programmer and just need more people on your project, that's A-OK.
